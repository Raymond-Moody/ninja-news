[Music] [Music] good morning everybody Welcome to the game plan jobs report has just hit I'm going to delve into it we're going to look at the data we're going to look at the charts and we're going to break it all down so without any further delay Happy Friday guys this is verified investing Studios let's get started all right so first and foremost we're going to start right here on the website so this is the verified investing website folks and basically this is your go-to right and there you have me there but basically right over here we have the market blast that's what I look at every single day here we're going to go to that and we're going to take a look at the key details so as we scroll down we have to look at the nonfarm payrolls report now the non-farm payrolls report came in way hotter than expected 303,000 jobs created expectations were for 200,000 last month was 270 it was reported last month at 275 it was revised down 5,000 now again 5,000 revision is not a big deal right if it was 100,000 that's a big deal this is basically in alignment with last month but this number folks the dollar ripped higher we saw the yields ripping higher now the market was rallying after yesterday's massive selloff it initially dipped and then kind of stabilized in fact we're still net positive what does this tell us about that big selloff yesterday guys check this out it tells us that when we were dumping out and again I even talked about this in trading the close yesterday it meant that people knew there were some players that knew this job number was going to be hot and they were dumping like crazy yesterday afternoon and that's why the Market's just dumped out insanely okay so let's talk unemployment rate unemployment rate comes in at 3.8% expectations were 3.9 last month was 3.9% so again a better number here lower unemployment right less people unemployed so everything here turning up roses and again what does this mean it means that the markets are expecting less rate cuts from the FED it's getting to the point folks I don't know if we're even going to get one rate cut this year unless all of a sudden we see a major downturn in the stock market futures again we're positive going into these numbers Al dumped out um and again we did see a rebound a little bit back up and we'll keep an eye on the markets uh participation rate I have in here it's 62.7% versus 62.6% that's how many people are participating in the workforce it did go up a little bit some speculation that some retirees are starting to work from home and that's why you're seeing that uptick in the participation rate the dollar ripped higher and the number here trading now 10452 we'll look at that chart 10year yield back to 4.4% and again surprisingly we're not seeing a big sell-off in the stock market okay now what are we going to do here we're going to go back to the homepage I want to show you guys the other key things that I wanted I look at on a daily basis so as we scroll down here again you can see by the way you can see the economic calendar that we have on the website here this is the earnings calendar this gets updated every weekend for the next week so that'll be on there and this is just a scrolling of all of the economic things that you might want to see now if we look down here we can click on the non Farm payrolls data this hasn't been updated with the new number yet just with the last month but you can see that generally we've been trending down but now we're seeing a number that basically comes back in at around 300,000 so we're right up in this vicinity right up here so again are we starting to re accelerate I personally don't think so but nonetheless it is interesting to note okay now next up we have to just take note that the jobs were created the sectors that had the most jobs over 60% of all the jobs were in Hospitality education and government basically so again you have to wonder is hospitality is that is that really is that people picking up part-time jobs that might be right picking up a waiter waitress job picking up something like that and again does that tell us some underlying factors about the economy we'll go into those details in just a minute all right back to the homepage here scrolling down by the way I have the unemployment rate the importance of you six we'll talk talk about that another time as well but as we scroll down the one thing and by the way look at the crypto heat map today that's not a pretty heat map for cryptocurrency this is yesterday's stock market it will update today once the Stock Market opens below here this is really what we want to focus on we have the fear and greed numbers right now we're now back to a neutral rating on the fear and greed for the stock market and we're still a little bit on the overbought side in the greed Zone greed zone for the crypto Market fear and greed index now the big thing here is the Fed tool right so let's click on this right here this is the Fed watch tool what are the numbers telling us we've seen that this June number right here and I'm sorry it's a little blurry on the screen here I don't know what's going on there I'm sure it'll refocus at some point but basically what we're seeing is it's now down to only a 5050 chance of fear or of essentially the FED cutting in June so we're getting to that point right there and we'll have to keep an eye on that all right let's go on to a few other things guys we're going to go to the actual charts I want to bring up the charts and take a look at what's going on this is the US dollar now before we get into the US dollar I just want to make a quick announcement we're going to spin the wheel in just a minute and we're going to do our latest round of winner right the winner for the latest round of things okay so the one thing I want to just mention is if you're if you are a current member of verified investing or in the money stocks just remember if you haven't been able to access the site there's an email we sent about a week ago that gave you all that information if you still have trouble just reach out to our support staff we have lots of people awesome people working on the support side to make sure that you get access to all the data that is for premium members if you have a premium account and again we showed I showed your homepage that's all free folks you can come check it out anytime you want here at verified investing a lot of those charts will be updated on a daily basis weekly basis monthly basis to make sure you guys have the information you need to make good decisions okay so looking at the dollar look at that rip on the dollar now before we get into drawing for today let's quickly go to the daily chart now this is amazing right so if we look at this daily chart of the US dollar we knew we had this big pattern right this big wedge pattern notice how we kept hitting hitting and we broke out and we confirmed now I've taught this so many times but I'm going to teach it again because I know we have new new viewers and I also know that if you're like me something has to be taught to me about 10 times before it actually sinks in right so what do we do here right so if we go to this and we look we had the confirmation breakout here and then what do we do we retrace to the scene of the crime yesterday then look at how it bounces and this is why the confirmation signal is so important I talk about this all the time when something confirms I don't chase the breakout right the dollar confirms I'm not buying the dollar up here instead I'm waiting for the retrace to the scene of the crime that's your opportunity now sometimes it doesn't hit but more often than not it does and it gives you a good solid entry price where you can actually make some good money so dollar is pushing higher today which would have been expected per the chart per the breakout and the retrace that's exactly what is playing out here now one other chart I want to show you guys we have to look here we're going to look at the pre-market data first and foremost this selloff yesterday was intense all right it was it's so intense I actually got in a spiders trade I actually ended up taking a decent Siz loss on it because it just didn't bounce and this was a day trade right but that's just the nature of the beast but ultimately the selloff here on the heavy volume was institutional money there's no doubt in my mind this was institutional money that somehow found out that the jobs report was going to be stronger so much stronger than anticipated right we were expecting 200,000 we came in 30 basically 50% higher 50% better number on jobs so again they basically pre- ran the market and now you're seeing just sideways you can see again here's the job data initially it dropped that it bounce now we're kind of just settling in here and kind of heading back down a little bit but nonetheless we're still net positive from yesterday's close but again there's no doubt about it this was some front running going on someone got the information ahead of time because it was way too coordinated way too intense where there was literally no bounces it was just massive sells side volume there okay going to the daily chart should anyone here be if you've watched this if you watched the game plan with me for I don't know a month should there anyone here be surprised that the markets are starting to turn down and the answer is no because we know we confirmed below the wedge pattern which changed it and I said this many times from a buy the dip Market to a sell the rip Market all right now again most retail investors will be buying the dip for a long time even as we come lower and lower until they get too scared because they're not getting the bounces that they want but again it's important to learn from the charts let the charts tell us where are we going on the S&P well ultimately there's a few levels to watch but you have to start looking at level like here where you get little flat tops and you get little bottoms right there see that kind of area right there where you went up you pulled back you went up pulled back and then you got above it and then pulled back here before going higher that gives us a general level and again it's right around 500 on the SNP or the spiders I should say this is the spider chart which is the tracking ETF for the S&P having said that ultimately I do still think that we are going far far lower all right there's just no way in my mind with inflation moving up and this is exactly what I predicted literally 6 months ago I said inflation is not going to get much below 3% and then it's going to start to move up again now it's not going back to 8% or 9% in the near term but it's going to creep up and it's going to handcuff the fed and you guys know that I've been talking about that longer term where are your major supports where would I think that we're going to go to in maybe the next six months I got to believe at some point we see a correction back to the previous all-time high from 2021 2022 and that would be a drop down to 480 secondary pivot right here at about 460 and then the longer term this one's going to be a big one the low from 2022 connected to the low of 2023 that level there will also be so those are your three downside Targets on the S&P 500 now what would make me think the markets are going to go higher here well if we look at the chart very simple if you reconfirm back inside or above this area well then the bias has to flip back to bullish but right now the bias is definitely on the bearish side all right before I forget guys I want to do a quick one here we're just going to quickly do our drawing yesterday someone won the uh one minute scalpel uh educational course $300 value trading the one minute chart incredible stuff it's actually going on sale I hope this weekend so take a look on verified investing this weekend for that course it is incredible literally I've even learned so much from it so again I hope you guys take a time to learn it as well all right who's going to win this one and then don't forget we're doing a drawing for who's going to win something on Monday and I have a special surprise for you guys all right the winner here guys is all right somber band at somber band right there guys again at somber band reach out to lton verified investing.com Lon verified investing.com okay so as we go into the more and more on these markets I do want to show the 10-year yield guys the 10-year yield surging to the upside as well now interestingly enough yesterday we saw the 10year yield pull back now why was the 10-year yield pulling back initially and the answer is pretty simple here is when you have a stock market that starts to collapse and yesterday was the first time I saw a drop like this in probably since 2021 2022 late 2021 2022 people run for safety when they run for safety because the stock market is collapsing they buy bonds now when you buy bonds it means demand for bonds goes up which means interest rates come down now we're seeing a reversal of that today because the reason why we saw the selling was probably because this jobs number was so strong and it means the FED is not going to cut as much and by the way I feel like a broken record because like a year ago I was like guys the fed's not going to cut so much and then it back then it was like 0 six cuts by early 2024 now we haven't even know had any cuts and we're almost mid year and it's now it was three now it's probably two or one I'm leaning more towards one the thing is too you have the election right so they're not going to want to cut unless the markets are collapsing in crash mode they're not going to cut around the election so you don't have much more time you have December later this year after the election or maybe one of the next couple meetings before it gets too close to that election either way are we going to break out from this level we closed above didn't confirm closed below closed above watch for confirmation maybe on Monday assuming we hold these gains all right uh quickly here let's go to the Nvidia chart Nvidia had a technical breakdown yesterday it is unconfirmed though but nonetheless if we look at this right what do we know well first of all remember when I called the the high was in on Nvidia based on this reversal engulfing candle that again even though we bounced higher I kept on saying to people everyone was like oh no it's going to go higher it's going to go higher I'm like listen just let the chart tell us we don't need to speculate all that does is stress us out if you close above the high of the reversal engulfing candle okay well then it yeah then it goes higher as long as you don't it do it the factors are to the downside the favoring is to the downside right well what do we do we come up here we never closed above that level and now look at this we've now broken a major trend line here on the daily chart on Nvidia now listen as I said it's unconfirmed so we have to see if it confirms if it confirms this is your next Target zone right here a major level here right around probably right around it looks like around 750 750 755 right in that vicinity now that's just one stop on a longer path in my opinion towards downside but nonetheless you should get some sort of technical bounce at that level um quickly looking at a couple of charts I mean look at the selling that's this was yesterday's intraday chart on AMD absolutely annihilated if we go to the daily chart here guys look at the break I mean this this chart essentially this could be a crypto chart cuz a lot of the crypto charts look like this but basically what we saw is this trend line right right okay so there it is look at how it's bare flagging underneath remember your bare flag look at that down move sideways what is that telling you notice how it's staying below that trend line so it's not recapturing the the support level and it's bearish consolidation and then you get down move like this now you will have a little bit of support coming in right in this area there'll be a couple levels I see a good one right here and a good one right here but either way this to me is a big breakdown and think about this guys AMD was up to $225 just basically a month ago and here it is at 165 and change is it going to go lower probably is doesn't mean it's not going to bounce but again I do think it's got to correct even more I would start to get interested on a swing basis Maybe in this range which looks like it's right around 140 to 150 on the chart okay so again guys interesting stuff there I'm trying to think if there's anything else we did see a big pop in the vix yesterday again that selling in the market made it for a big pop we still are into key levels I want to show you this this trend line on the vix here because I do think it's important to kind of take note of so if we take a trend line on the vix and we drag this out this is your break point right in here okay so right now look at that line on the vix and and the Reason by the way for those of you that don't know the vix is the fear indicator it's it's the volatility index um the reason you pay attention to it and I always say this is that when the vix is super low like 13 or 12 or 10 you can basically expect complacency in the market but it's also an opportunity to start accumulating shorts as well as long Vick and be careful about you know basically when people are complacent it means no one expects anything bad to happen and that's usually when something bad happens because no one expects it when everyone expects something bad it usually means everyone's prepared and therefore you don't get the same selling right now we have massive complacency in the market everyone just assumes we're going to go up up up and also to keep in mind we've heard Banks I mean how many big big institutions have upgraded the S&P in the last month you know again I'm looking at that and I'm like dude it's exit liquidity like like well to be honest they they might actually believe it but based on the charts I'm like nope not at least not now doesn't mean we can't later on go up but at least for now bias is definitely to the downside all right guys we're going to do a wheel spin real quick here let's find out what we are going to win for next uh next Monday and I'm going to do a wheel spin here hold on keep it going keep it going keep it going let's go oh look at that the winning Trader series amazing I promised you guys we'd do the winning Trader series all right that's 5,000 I think it's actually on the website for 10 but but we'll call 5,000 either way amazing there one of you guys will get the winning Trader series for free it's literally 20 just about 20 hours of everything in my head everything I've ever learned um and it's it's on video format I put it on video format it's kind of my legacy where at some point I do want to retire and I want you guys to continue to learn so again Monday someone will win the winning Trader series and again I know you guys have been asking for that it just hasn't hit on the board I wouldn't mind if it hit multiple times but someone will win that don't forget you have to be following verified investing on YouTube and you have to be or you have to be following it on Twitter and also just remember that at the end of this at the end of the stream I'll ask you guys a question to answer underneath that's how we can do the lottery from questions the the the answers that we get from underneath all right let's go over here real quick guys let's take a look here this is the natural gas chart up here now again KN gas is pulling back overall I'm okay with that notice again this trend line here we're still above it I want to see these two trend lines hold and then I think you could be making bullish consolidation for an up move on natural gas we will get into Bitcoin in a second I do want to quickly go over oil real quick here um in fact I'm going to go to my other oil chart as I have more annotation stuff on there so if we flip over here guys oil absolutely 100% confirmed Above This level so what does that mean well just like we looked at on the chart of of the dollar just a little while ago it means that this now this 83 to $84 level now becomes technical support all right it also means that there's a chance we could be going a lot higher on oil now just this week alone I think oil's up six or 7% this is the first week of April so this inflation move of 67% on oil is not going to be reflected till next month's CPI but next week we have last month's CPI which was still up on oil I didn't even calculate out I think oil was up another % last month as well so this is the key guys is that inflation is so tied to oil because oil is in everything right it's our gas tanks through gas of cars it's Transportation it's in plastics it's in everything and so the higher this goes the more negative it is for the Federal Reserve because they cannot act if you have inflation at 4% let's just say which is arguably where we're probably headed over the next month or two and you see the FED cutting rates what do you where do you think inflation goes at that point if they start printing money recklessly and again we're not even talking about the US government and how much debt that they're basically printing by just borrowing money but you're talking about inflation going north to 10% and by the way if you look at the 1970s and by the there's a chart on the homepage that goes into this where you can see the 1970s waves of inflation but that could be where we're headed uh in the charts of inflation either way where could we go on the oil chart there was some analysis I was doing here I want to just just show you guys this there's a parallel line here right so we can look at this parallel and I'm a big fan of parallels you guys know you probably see them every stream from me but there's a parallel line that actually gives me a Max upside Target around this 105 level 100 105 level now I hope we don't see oil that high frankly because if oil's that high we're in a big pickle I would almost guarantee that if oil's that high the stock market's down 10 to 20% at that point we've actually seen this in correlation one thing I want to show you guys real quick is if we flip over to the 10-minute chart I'm going to get rid of these trend lines is that the exact moment yesterday that oil began to pop that's when the market started to sell off so right here this move on oil right right here you can see it's just shows just before that 600 p.m time frame this is again different time frame than here in the east coast but that's exactly when the the stock market which had opened up like this right it's exactly when the stock market started to collapse and as oil ripped higher the stock market collapsed faster and so there's this inverse correlation of those two now we got to look into Bitcoin real quick guys and I want to cover Bitcoin and gold and even maybe touch on Silver real quick here um Bitcoin is reversing some of the upside from yesterday the positive for Bitcoin it recaptured this trend line remember it was unconfirmed so that the factors tell you that the probability is it still can get above that line very easily and it did that that's exactly what the confirmation level alerts you to it has hasn't confirmed now we are moving back below if we close below today watch for confirmation next week now you I say I say next week crypto trades 247 even on the weekend so I guess there's a possibility it confirms on the weekend I don't like confirmation that occurs on weekends for crypto because there's no volume behind it I want to see if confirmation with volume that tells me big money is actually doing it versus just a couple small Traders trading some leverage over the weekend all right next up again guys we can touch base on gold real quick gold initially was selling off today now it's moving back higher notice the dollar is ripping and gold is actually going up this is because people are scared people are buying the safety of gold this is an incredible chart on gold don't forget my target range is still up here if I flip over to my weekly chart actually I think we have to go to the monthly here real quick if we go to the monthly chart and zoom out you guys know where that Target is by looking at this trend line all right so trend line 2320 2330 on that front if we flip over to Silver Silver's pulling back just a little bit that's to be expected remember it confirmed so what do we know well where would it where would be like like for me I'm I I I I'm play a disciplined Trader right so the idea is that I won't be a buyer up here it's too extended but if it comes back to this line right here that's a confirmed breakout that should be your area of support so I'll be interested I don't know if I'll buy it but I will be interested at that level on Silver and then lastly here guys let me see if there's anything else we touched on Nat gas already um I did want to look at ethereum real quick cuz ethereum's in a little bit of a pickle here it is right at this trend line so big trend line hit here big bounce hit here Cho sideways it looks like it's going below remember it has to confirm so as long if it closes below no big deal right well it's not a it's not that it's not a big deal it's just you start watching it but it's not an official breakdown but just watch this trend line on ethereum if this trend line breaks ethereum honestly could be headed back to 2700 if we confirm all right guys um wow
