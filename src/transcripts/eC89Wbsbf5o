first guest says the FED will likely need to see 0.2% core pce prints over the next few months in order to deliver an initial rate cut in June joining us now is Brett Ryan deuts Bank senior us Economist Brett it is great to have you on the show maybe uh just start big picture Brad me you get your take on that CPI print hotter than expected what did you make of it Brad and how do you think what do you think the FED made of it yeah sure thank you Josh and uh you know as Jared said I think you know the FED woke up this morning and wasn't too happy with the inflation print um as they've laid out the story from the March summary of economic projections they really needed to see 20 basis points uh for the next two prints on core pce to kind of justify um starting uh that midcycle adjustment process um without you know seeing a deterioration the labor market or growth that kind of goes out the door with today's print and I think it's it's not just about you know can they go July June versus July the window was kind of small was somewhat small to begin with because you're going to run into um some difficult comps over the back half of the year in terms of year over year uh and so you know I think From fed's perspective um if they're not able to go in June July um then it become then you have to start thinking about you know can they go at all this year um or at least you know uh some sometime at the end of the year like the November or or December meetings but without any sort of uh without a clear indication of inflation moving back towards Target which today's data definitely do not speak to um you know with absent a labor market shock or or something else on the growth front uh it's hard to see uh significant break Cuts this year um and on the flip side BR you even have Larry Summers raising the Spectre of another rate hike do you think that that is sort of out of the realm of possibility here I think the the the probabilities are still very much skewed towards uh Cuts than hikes as the minutes kind of showed um you know this afternoon the minutes from the March meeting they were fairly confident that they they' reached the peak rate um I think it would take you know several more months of these type of data uh to bring the prospects of of hikes back on the table the fed's not going to hike one more time um you know if they were going to to hike it would be you know for 50 basis points or more uh and then I think you would need about six months of of of bad inflation prints to sort of justify that and Brett when you see these kind of inflation prints we're getting though I mean one question a natural question would be did the FED not hike enough Brett yeah so one of the interesting um Point things about the the March meeting was that there was a lack of of of discussion around the long run neutral rate you did see that rate um come up slightly just a tenth uh in the march sumary of economic projections but you know the market expectation is already well above the FED um if you look at measures like five year five year forward the market expectation for the longer run nominal rate is more like 3.5% or thereabouts um and so the FED is sort of you know behind the curve if you will in terms of admitting that you know perhaps the longer run you know neutral rate is significantly higher than where they currently have at penil in um the conventional wisdom has been that inflation not slowing down is reflecting strength in the economy at what point does that run the risk of curdling to some extent and the higher persistently higher prices that we've seen causing more damage to the US economy or just you know sort of it seeing its own um weakening regardless of where prices are going well I think the the way to think about it is through you know the growth rates right inflation's not just a a step onetime step up on a level of prices um even though you know many consu consumers certainly are are annoyed that they haven't seen any declines in prices um and the inflation progress to the extent that it's persistent uh particularly in core Services is going to Warrant uh a response from the FED May warrant a response from the fed and that response from the FED is going to be remember back in August of last year U when pal was talking about the conditions the FED needed to see um to to stop hiking rates and and those conditions were um you know labor market Cooling and growth cooling well we have strong growth we have a strong labor market and you know rate Cuts were on the board so long as inflation was improving when that stops improving and clearly stops improving or if we stall out here it's going to Warrant uh you know a monetary policy response and that becomes a threat to growth Brad I'll get you out in this you know we got CPI now we have PPI on Deck what are your expectations there yeah so the PPI again it's not about headline in core it's really about those components that feed into the core PC deflator so one of the major ones we got today from CPI is the rents the rental component and and that of course was was still fairly strong um the main components that we're looking for tomorrow are Health Care Services uh as well and as well as portfolio management now Healthcare Services uh has one the highest weights in the core PC deflator it's similar to to that of rents um and you know when you talk about that super core number what the FED is really looking at is the pce uh measure of super core not necessarily the CPI one um and then portfolio management is one where you know that that really uh it's it's predicated basically on the it's um a one month lag to equity price performance so the fact that you had a strong uh Equity price movement um you know in in uh beginning of the year you would argue for a fairly High print on portfolio management um and you know the FED may look through that uh you know given the equity prices have come off recently but the bottom line is that if you laid out this you know Narrative of of core PC inflation coming down to you know below 2.6% your year-over-year rate and Q 4 which is your forecast you're not looking like you're going to hit that um you know with the prints that we have now we're looking at right now on Cor PC which are more like 30 basis points um so you know tomorrow's data will will round out our understanding of uh and add some Precision to our core PC forecast um but right now it's looking like somewhere above 30 basis points interesting we'll keep a very close eye on it and to your point about um Equity prices having come off the S&P for example is only down about 2% from its high so still uh not that much downside all said and done Brett thank you so much great to see you great thank you for having program today Julie and Josh thank you
