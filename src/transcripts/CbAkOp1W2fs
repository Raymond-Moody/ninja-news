a spark turn into a flame and then we know what happened the communications center of the ship burned down now this is one of the newest addition to the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet because it was added to it in 2015 so it's in every standard a very modern new Russian ship and now it is uh burnt it the restorent of this ship will take a long time check out this video my friends this is the layout of the ship of course and this is the video that the Ukrainian gur published I mean it's it's in bis a city on the Baltic Sea very close to Finland and Estonia very very far away from Ukraine and Ukrainian intelligence published this video boom you see a spark happening I don't know if this is a battery or whatever is this device right here but a spark happened into a big flame Kaboom very good beautiful and this is all this very modern communication stuff in this new Russian ship it's now burnt it is demilitarized it is sleeping with the fish is let's call it like that due to the fire inside the missile ship its communication and automation equipment were completely destroyed restoring its compatibilities will require a long time beautiful and now my friends I want to give you a little bit of a giggle before we go on with our dues day cuz I know you need it and I need it it's dark times we need some funny funds look at this gim watching their newest Baltic sea ship burn to ashes oh no sad moment of course we got a burning house girl I mean this girl here got to be budanov there's budanov face missing here Putin and zilinski are playing uh how do you call it bombing the

friends you have contributed 77% or 92,000 within 2 days of this fundraiser combine ours birthday party let's give Ukrainian units some NATO standard Doctrine drones these drones are made in Estonia of course we will also give Ray trucks as you can see on these photos we will'll give five of them and also five drones with this we are fighting against the DJI Supremacy in Ukraine because we all know China is sharing DJI Intel with Russia so we want to fight against that bring Ukraine fully into NATO giving them NATO drones made in Estonia go and contribute my friends link is in the description [Music] below hello my friends and for the first time I'm not making a fundraiser video for you from Ukraine but from Estonia my home country I am in front of C Works an Estonian drone company and they have produced something extremely beautiful for us what is this this is not a DJI drone it is not a Chinese made drone it is an Estonian made drone with Estonian technology it's a thermal drone with a range of 20 km it's a Recon drone it's everything that right now is done in Ukraine by Chinese drones and that is bad because Russia and China they do exchange intelligence this is our weapon against that Alliance this is the West versus the new axis which is Russia and China and my friends I will call upon you to donate on this new Campaign which is called the combined arms birthday party cuz my birthday party is coming up on 24th of April buy five of these new drones we will send them to Ukrainian Elite forces Elite drone operators they will test them out and this will be the main alternative to the DJI a non-chinese an Estonian product safe NATO product for Ukrainian troops to use their Recon abilities on this drone will guide fpv drones to Russian positions and Russian tanks and it will save lives directly donation link is in the description below through donating you will help to liberate Ukrainian territory one destroy Russian tank at a time let's do it my friends like you have done it many times before [Applause] slav my friends talking about accidents lately all of my videos are about accidents in Russia because they happened so much Russia is a vast country with vast infrastructure mostly built in the Soviet times half a century ago not maintained for 50 plus years I mean you don't need to be an oracle or a genius to know what happens it breaks that's how robustly easy it is and today I bring to you a bridge collapse in Russia molans region let's watch the video look at this my friend this used to be a bridge and if you fix if you repair if you maintain these things don't collapse bridges are pretty robust you got to just maintain them regularly and they will keep being bridges for a long periods of time but Russia doesn't maintain anything anywhere ever so even Bridges can collapse yeah it's a huge issue now because this is the main connection link between Russia and Belarus the biggest and Main Logistics connection link so it is of course you can bypass it there are many roads but this is an issue a big issue look at this my friends more juicy videos about the collapse of this bridge and Russians are like oh you know did this happen what happened oh I don't know itly collaps ukrainians did it no Mr Russian person if you're watching this was the lack of Maintenance in the last 20 years that Putin has been in power my friends and now we jump to another location in Russia because I know you guys love it we jump to orsk City and the refinery that were flooded because a dam broke now this dam was just built horribly it was fully like the company who built it fully corrupt stole most of the money and just buil it that with the cheapest materials ever possible because they don't have a things called European building standards these standards ensure that you build things properly and they last in Russia they don't have that and now we have the guy who is the owner of the company who built the dam thanks to who now hundreds of thousands of people are underwater flooded their houses are flooded let's see what he has to say about this whole Shenanigans and get your popcorn Sergey vich and if the crest of the dam with stood and the water began to wash the dam Away From Below by the way it began to wash it up in advance then what is the problem what was it badly compacted so basically they're asking the owner of the company who built the dam thanks to who people are very suffering right now he's like what's up Serge what what's going on Serge tell me now now the owner of the company in Russia this is bardak what we call this is prosta you bued something prosta mean in Russia means simple it means you just build it with tuck tape in Russia and he says that's a mystery to me too I assume two factors the human Factor Someone drilled with a horizontal Direction drilling machine and laid some pipelines for sew discard let's say into the Ural but having looked at the footage in what places the bridge occurred this Factor was out so he just said oh there could be a human factor but looking at the footage it's not the human factor so what is the factor only one remained rodents which could have chewed through this Dam a two to 3 cm hole would be enough for the water to go through the dam oh my godil please pardon me that is we are building a dam for a billion rubles oh my God only for it to be chewed through by rodents how is this even possible oh Russia it's a beautiful country I mean what what if they finally fix up that country I can I cannot laugh that much anymore yeah they they put like a billion rubles of stolen money from Russian people by Putin you know they give it to this company whose owner is probably a friend of Putin's friend or something and he takes most of the money puts it in his pocket buys a Bentley or something 10 Bentley in a castle and then builds the dam with just dirt it wasn't a dam as you could see from the video this is look at the Netherlands they know how to do stuff with water they build dams this was just dirt piled up and rodents chewed through it and like mice made holes in that Dam oh who would have known o i I don't know I would have known would you have known being sarcastic to Oblivion here because it's just Russian Bardock Keep It Coming Russia it's funny my friends I'm not getting you this shig against even continues now hundreds of thousands of people whose homes were flooded they lost everything they have thanks to this corruption they have in Russia and the stealing of their own money by the government by Putin who has commenced a system like that these people in or people who are suffering who lost everything their children have to be in wet and cold now they come to the street they want to change something oh we are not cheap we will do something in Russia what will we do well my friends let's watch the video what will they do Putin help us help us Putin help us this is a flock of sheep my friends these are not people they're sheep and Putin is the leading sheep have you seen that video where there's no fence but there are two posts and the leading sheep goes through it and you could go through everywhere but everybody follows because they're sheep they don't think if they suffer because of it or they move slower through that small thingy they still go through there because they're sheep this is what we see on this video these people's homes were just destroyed because of Putin and his last 20 years stealing the money and infrastructure from the Russian people and they are making the Sheep out that I don't know if it's in English she sheep sounds for the Puttin come and help them oh my God this is a comedy it's a comedy but now my friends we'll go to Ukraine with a completely different understanding of people Civil Society is something that does not exist in Russia it is something that is Raising its head in Ukraine the last 10 years ever since this revolution of dignity of 2014 we have gotten civil society which side effects by the way are people's ability to think for themselves so here we have a Ukrainian far who has to make de and feed his village and his people just make feed his wife and children even but his fields are filled with Russian mind so what does he do he can go and be like selinski help me please or he can change his circumstances like a real man like a real boss that's what it does let's see despite the war sewing season continues in Ukraine first a d mining tractor checks the field for mines there is no driver the tractor is controlled remotely we created a special machine a mechanism with change and here in this sentence I will pause and I will enjoy this minute my friends talking about this this is the main difference between Russians and ukrainians and I'm not even comparing with the West cuz there's no comparison but ukrainians see a very horrible situation that they are not to blame for because it's Russian army came and mined their fields now they cannot eat because they cannot SW crops because they cannot sell it and they cannot get money it's all bad so two options either I blame the russan and I wait for my government to save me or I do something because I'm a man and I can control my own life and the circumstances around me and myself and I can motivate myself to do something and jump over this hurdle this is what I respect about people different people and in ukrainians I see this all the time I go to kia I love that country to hell because I see how people react to the worst and horrible circumstances around them they're like this is bad but we will make the most out of it I have so much respect for this farmer here his fields are mind it's dangerous he has to work three times as hard as before to even get something and he's doing it he's taking matters into his own hands he's not dependent on some other outside power Putin or zinski whoever supposed NATO supposed to come and help he is doing his lot what he can I respect it and I will help that Nation as much as I can with my fundraisers the chains hit the ground and if there is something there it will detonate its main task is to save lives of people our employees cases of farmers being hit by mines in your Ukraine are not rare look at this look at this they made this they us their head not being a flock of sheep saying Putin help us but they use their head to create this machine to clear the fields to sue the crops to sell the crops to make money to feed their families oh it's a beginning of something beautiful the ability to think for yourself to take matters into your own hands the start of democracy we try to create such a machine at minimal cost yes I love thator this is such a praise for ukrainians I love this sentence so much because everything everything in every system every business is to create something in a scalable way Mass producible way and the cheapest way possible so it does the job not the prosta Russian way because if it breaks it's pointless so you can of make it too cheap but the cheapest way possible that it works there's a difference we realize that this may be its last route depending on what we run into after Russia Retreat Farmers find almost all kinds of mind and bombs in their fields respect slini these Ukrainian Farmers deserve every good thing coming their way they are the beginning of a self thriving self-governing Nation love it so much my friends now we jump into a completely different topic because we jump into a Russian trend French and a Russian strong point underground 45 of course it's it's somewhere where the men sleep on the front what's going on here my lad you're dancing why you're so happy turn around so I can see you oh you turned around so this is a foreign mercenary fighting for the Russians and he's very happy is dancing now it's so bizarre and it says everything this one video which seems like it's saying nothing it's pointless says everything because they have these foreign mercenaries this says that Russia needs Manpower otherwise they could get it from Russia if Russia has so much Manpower in Russia why are they hiring foreign mercenaries that means something second of all listen to the song Russian culture who supposed to be according to Putin according to Russian people who are supporting you know proar people Pro Putin people it's the best culture we don't want the West we don't need the West we have our own great culture 1,000 years Russia everything that the third right what was doing and what is the song they're listening on the front while fighting the West what is love it's one of the zers of the western culture if if you think about western music this could definitely be one of the pillars of that music it's it's a everybody knows that song So this video says so much more they might say one thing but if you look at the footage and real life of the Russians every Russian radio almost plays western music every bigger one so secretly inside they're so butt hurt they want to be like the West they have always copied the West Peter the Great was the Russian Zar a very great Zar who westernized Russia he did everything every law he did everything was to copy France and England and Germany that's what he did and it has been going on like that for centuries they want to copy the west but they can't because they're not able to govern themselves copying the West meaning your people must be educated and able to govern themselves and not be sheep but in Russia that's not possible unfortunately my friends look at this Russian tank and it's it's Priceless look at it it they built a whole house on top of it to defend It Against drones look at this and I wouldn't show this if we wouldn't have something funny this honestly it looks like it's ready for spice harvesting when your spice this is a dune quote when your spice squads are So High by the emperor you have to build these tanks to fight the sandworms and fighting sandworms they did I'll show you we have actual footage 2 minutes of Drone footage which I canot show you the links in the description below of this tank roaming around on the fields followed by other tanks it was an armored Assa and it was the leading tank they tried to break through Ukrainian positions you know what happened they really are on to something here because they were all destroyed yeah nothing new about it didn't help them at all my friends and now for the second time in this week I will butcher some buy me a coffee monthly members to
