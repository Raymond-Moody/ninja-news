WE CAN'T GET A STRONG EMPLOYMENT NUMBER LIKE WE DID ON FRIDAY AND JUST FORGET ABOUT IT ON MONDAY. IT'S TOO IMPORTANT TO LEAVE IN THE DUST LIKE SOME KIND OF RUN OF THE MILL DATA POINT. SO ON A DAY WHERE THE DOW DIPPED 11 POINTS, TS&P EDGED DOWN, I THINK IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT IF NOT RESURRECTING WHAT THE NONFARM PAYROLL REPORT MEANS FOR OUR ECONOMY AND OUR STOCKS. FIRST AS I'VE SAID FOR YEARS, THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL SET OF NUMBERS WE GET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOTHING EVEN COMES CLOSE TO THE MONTHLY LABOR REPORT. THAT'S HOW BIG IT IS. I FIRST ANALYZED THIS OVER A DECADE AGO, AND IT'S NEVER LOST ITS SIGNIFICANCE WHEN I LOOK OVER THE YEARS. THIS IS THE NUMBER THAT CONTROLS A LOT OF THE NARRATIVE. SO LET'S BREAK DOWN THE RELEASE. FIRST THING THAT CATCHES MY EYE IS THE HOUSEHOLD SURVEY WHERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 3.8%. THE ECONOMY CREATED JOBS LAST MONTH. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WE HAVE 3.8% UNEMPLOYMENT. [ APPLAUSE ] WHEN WE'VE HAD 11 RATE HIKES? HISTORICALLY HIGH, WHEN THE FED IS ATTEMPTING TO SUCK LIQUIDITY OUT OF THE SYSTEM? CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW LOW THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD BE IN THIS ECONOMY IF THE FED WERE TO TRY TO CREATE JOBS INSTEAD OF STAMP THEM OUT TO BEAT INFLATION? RIGHT NOW THIS ECONOMY IS NOTHING SHORT OF AN ECONOMIC MIRACLE. THE 303,000 JOBS CREATED IS MUCH HIGHER THAN 231,000 AVERAGE OVER THE PRIOR MONTHS THAT IS REMARKABLY HOT. THIS MORNING I GOT TO INTERVIEW GINA RAIMONDO ABOUT A GRANT THAT TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR SO IT CAN HELP SUPPORT AN INVESTMENT OF $65 BILLION IN LEADING EDGE SEMICONDUCTOR FOUNDRIES IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. IF IT TAKES $6.5 BILLION TO GET $65 BILLION INVESTMENT, THAT'S PRETTY DARN GOOD CARROT. WHEN WE DRILLED DOWN, MADAM SECRETARY SAID THE PROJECT WOULD CREATE 20,000 CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND 6,000 DIRECT MANUFACTURING JOBS WHEN FINISHED. I, FRANKLY, WAS FLABBERGASTED, BECAUSE I COULDN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO FIND THESE PEOPLE. IT'S GOING TO BE BORDERLINE IMPOSSIBLE WITH UNEMPLOYMENT THIS LOW. WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DOCUMENTED AND PERMITTED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY. AND AMERICA DOESN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH ENGINEERS TO ENSURE THAT TAIWAN SEMI CAN GET THINGS GOING BY THE END OF THE DECADE. GIVEN THAT THESE ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST CHIPS, AT LEAST FOR RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GOING HAVE TO RECRUIT LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. WE ONLY PRODUCE 70,000 UNDERGRADUATE ENGINEERS RIGHT NOW. TAIWAN, A SMALL ISLAND NATION WITH NOT EVEN A TENTH OF OUR POPULATION HAS 11 MAJOR ENGINEERING PROGRAMS WITH 176,000 STUDENTS. WHAT A DISPARITY. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT OUR COUNTRY ADDED 39,000 CONSTRUCTION JOBS IN MARCH, ABOUT DOUBLE THE AVERAGE MONTHLY GAIN, IT'S WORTH ASKING WHERE THE HECK TAIWAN SEMI IS SUPPOSED TO FIND AN EXTRA 20,000 CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. MAYBE IN THE GREATER PHOENIX AREA. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THEY WANT DO TO DO A NATIONWIDE 167. THIS IS NOT THE OLD DAYS WHERE THERE WAS PLENTY OF SURPLUS LABOR IN THE UNITED STATES. MOST TELEPHONE OTHER NUMBERS LIKE PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT WERE LITTLE CHANGED IN MARCH. THESE NUMBERS WOULD TYPICALLY BE GOING UP, MAYBE UP BIG AT THIS POINT IN THE BUSINESS CYCLE WOULD PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON WAGES. NO, IT'S NOT HAPPENING. AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS FOR ALL EMPLOYEES INCREASED BY 0.3%. OVER THE PAST 12 MONTH WAGES ARE UP 4101 POUNDS WERE. THAT'S INCREDIBLY CONSISTENT AND STRONG. IT MAKES ME QUESTION WHETHER THE FEDS SHOULD DECLARE THEY WERE DONE TIGHTENING. WITH THIS HOT LABOR REPORT, IT SURE FEELS LIKE THEY LEFT THE JOB UNFINISHED. WE PUT 72,000 PEOPLE TO WORK IN HEALTH CARE. NOW WE KNOW NURSES ARE SHORT, BUT 18,000 ARE IN NURSING AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES. WHERE THE HECK ARE THEY GOING TO FIND THESE PEOPLE? OR HOW -- FIND MORE OF THESE PEOPLE. OR HOW ABOUT HOSPITAL WORKERS? THEY ADDED 27,000 JOBS. COULD THAT BE MORE POST-COVID SURGERY, SOMETHING WE KNOW HAS HURT THE HEALTH INSURERS? THEY HAVE TO KEEP HIRING PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THE PRICE OF LABOR IS GOING TO GO MUCH HIGHER. WE'RE CONSTANTLY DISCUSSING THE STATE OF THE CONSUMER. AREN'T THEY CASH STRAPPED AT THIS POINT? APPARENTLY WE SHOULD STOP WORRYING, PEOPLE. EMPLOYMENT, LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY TRENLDED UP BIG. THE REPORT SAID, AND THIS HOW RETURNED TO PREPANDEMIC FEBRUARY 2020 LEVELS. THAT'S AN INCREASE OF 49,000 JOBS. THAT'S ANOTHER SIGN OF A ROARING ECONOMY. IT COULD BE THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE. COG BACK TO WORK AND GOING OUT TO THE SAME OLD PLACES. IT COULD BE THAT PEOPLE HAVE STARTED BEING MORE SOCIAL. IT COULD BE PEOPLE ARE LONG ON MONEY AND SHORT ON TIME AND REALIZE THEY'D MISS TODAY MUCH OF LIFE WHEN THEY WERE COOPED UP IN THEIR HOMES FOR COVID. REMEMBER, COVID CHANGED OUR HABITS, AND UNCHANGING THEM IS NOT EASY. THEN THERE IS ONE THAT SEEMS BEYOND THE PALE. GOVERNMENT HIRING AT 71,000 POSITIONS? WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE MONTHLY GAIN. THESE ARE THE BIG GAINERS. EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME, WHICH IS A STATEMENT IN ITSELF. NOW THERE COULD BE SOME GIVE HERE FROM IMMIGRANTS WHO GET DOCUMENTED WORK STATUS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT WON'T DISCLOSE THOSE NUMBERS. I UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM BECAUSE IT'S POLITICALLY SENSITIVE. BUT UNLESS WE GET MORE WORKERS OR MORE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS, THE ECONOMY COULD STAY TOO HOT, AND LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES WILL KEEP CLIMBING, AS THEY WERE TODAY. THEY'RE BACK TO NOVEMBER'S LEVEL. SO NOW LET'S ZOOM OUT. WE KNOW THAT EMPLOYMENT TRULY DECIDES CONSUMER SPENDING, WHICH IS ABOUT 75% OF OUR ECONOMY. WE COULD MAKE A TON OF PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT THE CONSUMER FROM THESE NUMBERS. TO THOSE WHO THINK CREDIT CARD USE IS UP BIG AND THEREFORE DANGEROUS, I COUNT WERE THESE EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. THESE NUMBERS SAY THAT'S SURPRISING, UNLESS THE AUTO COMPANIES HAD SUCH BAD SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS THAT THEY FINALLY CAUGHT UP AND ARE NOW RUNNING ALL THE JOB CREATION WITH THIS NEW PRODUCT UNSALEABLE EVs. THESE NUMBERS SAY WHY WE LEARNED WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING MAKE SENSE. THAT'S BLACKSTONE REAL ESTATE, A DIVISION OF BLACKSTONE. JUST SHELLED OUT $10 BILLION FOR AIR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S A BIG REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST. OWNS HIGH QUALITY RENTAL HOUSING IN COASTAL MARKETS LIKE MIAMI, LOS ANGELES, BOSTON AND WASHINGTON, D.C. A.I.R. COMMUNITIES REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST QUALITY LARGE SCALE APARTMENT THEY EVER BOUGHT. MY DECISION TO BUY THE PROPERTIES MAKES ME THINK WHILE OFFICE REAL ESTATE MAY BE QUESTIONABLE, APARTMENTS MIGHT BE UNDERVALUED. THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN WHEN STEVE MNUCHIN POURED A BILLION INTO NEW YORK, WHICH SEEMED DIALSY BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE UNITS WERE RENT CONTROLLED. HERE BLACKSTONE PUT IN $4 MILLION TO INVEST TO PURSUE FURTHER GROWTH. YOU DON'T DO THAT IF YOU BELIEVE THIS ECONOMY IS FACING A HARD LANDING OR EVEN A SOFT LANDING ONLY MAKE THAT KIND OF DECISION WHEN YOU THINK IT'S A NO LANDING SCENARIO, WHICH IS WHAT I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE. WHICH BRINGS ME FULL CIRCLE. WE HAVE A ROBUST ECONOMY. SO I'M A LOT LESS WORRIED ABOUT THIS UPCOMING EARNINGS SEASON. WHEN I CHECKED THE RECORD HISTORICALLY, THIS KIND OF JOB CREATION WITHOUT A TON OF INFLATION IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GET, REGARDLESS WHERE SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES ARE SITTING. BOTTOM LINE, IF YOU'RE HOPING FOR FEBRUARY FED RATE CUTS FROM THE FED, DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. THIS ECONOMY DOESN'T NEED IT. JUST BE GLAD WE AREN'T GETTING ANY MORE RATE HIKES. YIKES. ED IN FLORIDA, ED? >> Caller: HEY, ED -- I MEAN, HEY, JIM. THIS IS ED. I'M CALLING FROM FLORIDA. I WANTED TO SEE IF YOUR OPINION ON ABBVIE, I'VE HAD IT FOR A WHILE. IT IS GOING TO BE GOING SIDEWAYS STILL OR IT'S A SELL OR A HOLD? >> IT'S BEEN HURT BY THE TURN AGAINST THESE STOCKS. BUT THE STOCK WAS AT 182. IT'S COME DOWN TO 169. I WOULD TELL YOU THAT I THINK AT 163, 164, I WOULD ACTUALLY START BUYING IT AGAIN. WE ON THE OTHER HAND IT FOR THE TRUST. WE SOLD IT. WE MADE A LOT OF MONEY. AND I'M LOOKING TO GET BACK IN, ONLY BECAUSE THEY MAKE BOTOX, AND BOTOX IS ESSENTIAL FOR A LOT OF TEASE PEOPLE TAKING GLP-1 DRUGS. LET'S GO TO BOB IN ILLINOIS. BOB? BOB, YOU'RE UP. IT'S JIM. >> Caller: OKAY. I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN CABO FOR A WHILE. IT'S SURGED FROM 45 TO 65. I GOT STOCKED OUT A LITTLE AROUND 60. AND NOW IT'S KIND OF FLOUNDERING. IS THERE A GOOD POINT TO GET BACK INTO IT? >> I LIKE CAVA RIGHT HERE. TO BE HONEST, I LIKE CAVA. I THINK IT'S A TERRIFIC SITUATION. IT'S COME DOWN FROM A HIGH. IT'S GOT TO ME IT'S GOT GREAT FUNDAMENTALS, LONG-TERM GROWTH. IT FEELS A LOT LIKE CHIPOTLE DID WHEN CHIPOTLE STARTED. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND THIS STOP TO BE EVER REALLY CHEAP. IT'S GOT TOO GOOD A BLOODLINE TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. ALL RIGHT. THIS ECONOMY DOESN'T NEED RATE CUTS. JUST BE GLAD WE AREN'T GETTING ANY MORE RATE HIKES. GOLD JUST TOUCHED ITS ALL-TIME HIGH. SO WHY AREN'T THE MINING STOCKS FOLLOWING THE PRECIOUS METALS FOOTSTEPS? I'M LISTING IMPORTANT REASONS WHY THERE IS A DICHOTOMY IN THE SPACE. >>> THEN, WE CONTINUE THE SERIES OF WINNING SMALL CAP STOCKS AND SEEING WHICH NAMES INVESTORS COULD, QUOTE, BANK ON FOR POTENTIAL GAINS. >>> AND YOU CAN FIND FERGUSON INSIDE YOUR HOME. YOU CAN FIND IT ON THE CONSTRUCTION SITE. BUT DOES THE STOCK DESERVE TO BE IN YOUR PORTFOLIO? I'M GETTING THE LATEST FROM THE CEO. SO STAY WITH CRAMER. â™ª >>> DON'T MISS A SECOND OF "MAD MONEY."
