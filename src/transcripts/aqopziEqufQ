EXTENT IN THE LAST CONFERENCE, BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT, I DON'T SEE THE LOGIC. >> FOR MORE ON RATES AND THE FED, LET'S BRING IN JIM BIANCO. YOU DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO SEE CUTS THIS YEAR, WHY? >> THE ECONOMY IS TOO STRONG RIGHT NOW. IT'S IN A NO LANDING PHASE, AS WE LIKE TO CALL IT. IT'S NOT A BOEING PLANE, THERE'S NO PARTS FALLING OFF OF IT. AND IT'S JUST CONTINUING TO MOVE ALONG AT A 2.5% OR 3% PHASE, ALONG WITH THAT CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY, AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PROBABLY BOTTOMING ON INFLATION AT AROUND 3%. NOW, I DON'T THINK WE GO MUCH BEYOND 4 AT THE MOST, BUT THAT'S NOT TWO, AND THE FED HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THEY NEED CONFIDENCE WE'RE GOING TO TWO AND WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT, AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HOLD. AND FINALLY, I'M IN THE CAMP THAT THE FED DOESN'T CHANGE POLICY IN THE SUMMER OF AN ELECTION YEAR. CHANGE POLICY. IF THEY WERE IN CUTTING MODE, THEY CAN CONTINUE TO CUT, BUT THEY'RE IN HOLD MODE. AND IF THEY DON'T PULL THE TRIGGER BY JUNE, THEN IT'S -- THEN IT'S NOVEMBER, DECEMBER, AT THE EARLIEST, ONLY IF THE DATA WARRANTS IT, AND RIGHT NOW THE DATA IS NOT. >> JIM, WE BOTH AGREE THAT RATES ARE GOING HIGHER, WE WERE PROVEN CORRECT. WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT, BUT WHAT'S THE CATALYST, IN YOUR OPINION, FOR RATES TO CONTINUE TO GO HIGHER IN TEN-YEAR FROM 4.30 TO 4.7 5, WHICH IS THE NEX LEVEL, IN MY OPINION. >> I THINK THEY MIGHT GO HIGHER. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE REALITY OF INFLATION IF WE'RE IN A 3% TO 4% INFLATION WORLD, WHICH IS WHAT I THINK WE ARE, THEN A 4.30 TEN-YEAR NOTE IS NOT ENOUGH IF YOU WILL, COMPENSATION FOR THAT. IT'S GOT TO GO HIGHER. I THINK THE YIELD CURVE STEEPENS. I THINK THAT WE EVENTUALLY START TO MAYBE DRAW A BEAT ON WHERE THE FUNDS RATE IS AT 5.25 TO 5.5, AND MAYBE SEE THE CURVE START HEADING TOWARDS A ZERO CURVE. YEAH, SO THE TEN-YEAR GOING OVER FIVE AS THE FUNDS RATE STAYS AT 5.25 TO 5.5. I DON'T THINK THAT IS A CONSENSUS VIEW RIGHT NOW IN THE MARKETPLACE. WE WERE ALMOST THERE IN OCTOBER, SO, IT'S NOT MUCH MORE THAN WHERE WE WERE IN OCTOBER, AND WHEN WE WERE AT 5% IN OCTOBER, WE WERE THROWING UP 3% GROWTH RATES IN THE ECONOMY, AND IT WAS ABLE TO HANDLE THAT LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES JUST FINE. >> JIM, SO, YOU MENTIONED THE DOMESTIC ISSUES THAT MIGHT LEAD TO HIGHER RATES. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE JAPAN CARRY TRADE AND PERHAPS THEM PIVOTING ON MONETARY POLICY AND WHAT AFFECTS THAT MIGHT HAVE ON RATES, AS WELL? >> YEAH, SO, IT'S A LONG TIME COMING. THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO RAISE RATES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 17 YEARS. AND THEY'RE GOING TO PROBABLY FINALLY GET OFF OF NEGATIVE RATES GOORATE RATES. IT'S WELL-EARNED, BECAUSE THEY GOT INFLATION ABOVE 2% IN JAPAN, AND YOU'RE RIGHT, IF YOU LOOK AT A CHART OF THE YEN/DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE, OVERLAID WITH THE TEN-YEAR YIELD, IT'S EFFECTIVELY THE SAME THING, BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE FINANCING OF TEN-YEAR NOTES COMES FROM JAPAN. IF INTEREST RATES ARE HEADING UP IN JAPAN, THEN A LOT OF JAPANESE PLAYERS THAT ARE PLAYING THAT TRADE WILL SAY, I'LL JUST LEAVE MY BONDS OR MY INVESTMENTS IN JAPAN, GET THE HIGHER YIELD IN JAPAN AND NOT TAKE THE CARRY RISK. AND JAPAN IS THE LARGEST OWNER OF TREASURIES IN THE WORLD, AND
