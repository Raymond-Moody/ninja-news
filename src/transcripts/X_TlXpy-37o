Used EV prices are falling. Buyers can get some great deals, but
some say it is yet another sign that demand is faltering. Low resale value could also be a major
deterrent to EV purchases and EV adoption more broadly. Others say it is just a blip and fears
of an EV slowdown are overblown. Studies show that used EV
prices fell somewhere around 30% in September and October 2023, from
the same period in 2022. Used vehicle prices overall saw
declines in the mid single digits for that time period. The mainstream appeal of these cars is
still not there. They're still too expensive and they've
got too many limitations in terms of how you use them. People are broke,
interest rates are high. The demand for EVs is not the issue,
it's the affordability. Some research indicates what many EV
supporters insist: EVs are cheaper to own than gasoline burning
cars. You don't have to shell out for gas,
and maintenance costs are lower, but a car's residual or resale value is a big
factor in determining the total cost of owning it. The volatility in the used
EV market shows how much isn't yet known about EVs, including how to predict
what one will be worth in a few years . A single change to policy, battery
technology, even a single manufacturer's prices can upset the whole market. These price drops come at a time when
many other data points suggest EV demand is stalling. New EVs are collecting
dust on dealer lots. Tesla, which controls nearly two thirds
of the EV market, has been aggressively cutting prices and its third quarter
deliveries fell short of investor expectations. Let me give you this general thought
that I hear from everybody in this business, including people at Tesla. This is still new. CNBC looked at data and talked to
insiders to determine whether used EV prices are a sign of a larger slowdown
in the EV market, or a bad investment altogether. One study showed that all used vehicles
up to three years old lost 4.8% in value from September 2022 to
September 2023, but EVs specifically fell 29.5%. Another show that from October 22nd to
October 23rd, the average price for 1 to 5 year old used
EVs dropped 33.7%. Meanwhile, used car prices only
fell 5.1% in the same period. A third showed they had fallen about
32% from September 22nd to September 23rd. That study said the average EV price as
of October 18th was $27,863, roughly the same as what it
was in early 2021. Some research indicates EVs have
the worst depreciation rates of any vehicle type, including,
by a narrow margin, big value losers like luxury vehicles. Hybrids are doing extremely well in
holding their value and EVs are doing extremely poor. Why is that? Because when you buy a hybrid, what do
you get? You get much higher fuel efficiency and
a higher fuel price. World we live in and zero range
anxiety. That's a powerful, desirable
combination. The trouble is not limited to the used
market. In January 2023, new car dealers had
about 52 days worth of EVs and internal combustion cars, but
internal combustion inventory held pretty steady between 52
days and 58 days throughout the year, while EV inventory soared to 111 days
in early July, then settled at 97 days by October. These numbers have fueled concerns that
demand for EVs is waning, but not everyone agrees. There has been a fierce debate over
what's actually happening. There's been this wave of what I would
call pretty misleading headlines over the last few weeks, like you would
think that EVs were dead and buried if you paid attention just to what the
news headlines were. Scott Case is CEO of Recurrent, which
creates vehicle history reports specifically designed to measure EV
battery life. It also publishes the Recurrent Price
Index, which tracks used EV sales. That index is among those showing
prices have fallen dramatically. If you wanted to say what's the single
biggest cause of used EV price drops, it's Elon Musk. Tesla controls about 60% of the new EV
car market, and in 2023, the company started a price war
that drove a lot of customers who would buy used EVs toward
new ones, especially Teslas. It also forced a lot of other
manufacturers to lower their prices as well, and the timing corresponds pretty
tightly with the Tesla price drops. Many of the 2022 models were current
tracks depreciated 20 to 40% over 2023. Nobody's going to pay the same for a
used car as they would for the new alternative. So you saw an immediate
drop in used Tesla prices, which then was followed by a
like a time delayed drop in the used prices for Tesla
competitors. In other words, plummeting EV values
don't reflect some kind of inherent problem with EVs, just the fact that
consumers who might otherwise buy used are opting for new Teslas instead. In addition, 2023 is the three year
anniversary of the Tesla Model Y, which in the third quarter of the year
was the best selling EV in the US. Three-year-old cars are a kind of
benchmark in the used market. Leased vehicles are often held for a
period of three years, and a large share of the cars on the used market are
vehicles coming off lease. Recurrent has found that on average,
new EV owners hold on to their cars for about 3 to 4 years before selling. That means a lot of 2020 Model Y's are
entering the used market. Driving up inventory. 2018, 2019 was just an incredible step
up in new EV production in the US. Tesla, but other manufacturers as well. And so that's what we're now seeing,
kind of come on to the used market at scale. Used EV sales now outpace the sales of
all new EV models except the model Y, and dwarf the sales of most of
them. They do, however, make up only a tiny
share of total used sales, about 1%. Finally, new federal tax credits
kicked in in 2023. These replaced the EV credits that had
been in place since 2009. The original plan offered buyers a
$7,500 credit for each of the first 200,000 EVs a manufacturer sold. The new credits offered the same amount
of money, but introduced a few new conditions centering on the price of
the vehicle, the buyer's income, battery capacity, and where the car is
assembled, among other things. January 1st of 2023. The $7,500 tax credit appeared on the
scene for new cars, so the immediate impact was
essentially dollar for dollar $7,500 decreases in used prices like
right at January 1st for any car that was sort of
getting eligibility for this new credit. In April 2021, there were about 11,000
used vehicles on US dealer lots and on dealer or manufacturer
websites. That doesn't include private sellers. By October 2023, there were three times
that. Two concepts to keep in mind. Residual value is what a car is
expected to be worth at the end of some term a lease, financing period,
subscription rental, or something else. It is often based on the price
the car would be expected to fetch on a wholesale market like a dealer auction
resale value is what a car is likely to be worth once you sell it on
the retail market. Used EV prices matter because residual
value and resale value are factors in determining the total
cost of owning a vehicle. Tesla has long argued that its cars
have a lower cost of ownership than comparably priced internal combustion
vehicles. When you include gas prices, which EV
owners don't have to worry about, and maintenance costs, which tend to be
lower as EVs have fewer moving parts. Calculating cost to own is complex and
varies tremendously depending on insurance costs, gasoline prices, and
electricity rates, among other things. In its 2023 five year cost to own
rankings, Kelley Blue Book said the Tesla model three had the lowest cost
of ownership in the luxury car category. The also electric Polestar two came in
second. What matters is that this idea that
we're going to all be driving electric vehicles in a relatively short
timeframe: 3, 4 or 6 years, this latest six months, and what's gone on
with electric cars really puts that into question. In my mind. The reality is that EV sales growth,
both on the new and the used side, is vastly outstripping combustion engine
sales growth. Case cites several statistics from
September 2022 to September 2023. New US vehicle sales on the
combustion side rose 13%, new US EV sales rose almost 60%. Sales of used EVs were up 40%, used
combustion cars fell 2%. But skeptics say that doesn't cover the
full story. Remember, there are three types of lies
lies, damned lies, and statistics. On the one hand, sales are growing, but
in the new market it is taking longer to sell an EV than a gasoline car. And in the used market, prices are
falling more dramatically. Elon wanted to hit a certain sales each
of his quarters this past year, and he was dropping his prices to do that, and
he still didn't hit his sales. What do falling prices and not hitting
your sales goals mean? They mean people are not buying the
cars at the rate that you thought they would. EV sales are not growing uniformly
across the country. Some evidence suggests that states with
the highest share of EVs like California, Oregon and Washington are
also the slowest growing markets. Brauer says there might be a kind of
natural ceiling for EV demand somewhere between 7 to 10% of the market, but
other data suggest EV sales are still growing steadily, In many of these
places. EVs tend to cost more than gasoline
counterparts, even with Tesla's price cuts and EV subsidies for at least some
models, new EVs often have higher sticker prices. Public charging is something that people
worry about. If I don't have a Tesla, where am I
going to charge it? La la la. Well, you know something? Somewhere between 70 and 75% of people
just charge at home. Most of the time. I think people and the government need
to embrace the reality that electric cars have some
advantages, and they can serve a role in personal transportation. They cannot be the solution and serve
the role in personal transportation until some big problems are solved. In 2024, what is now a tax credit needs
to be filed on a tax return will become a point of sale rebate, $7,500
on a new EV and $4,000 on a used EV. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see a
coming surge in both categories starting in January, when someone can
basically get cash in their pocket right at point of sale rather than having to
wait. You know what essentially would be 18
months to file their taxes and have a reduction in their tax liability. But for people who have bought a new EV
in 2023, there might be another hitch to pay attention to. Three years down the
road, the terms for the $7,500 tax credit on new EVs in 2023 were
tightened considerably. If you're buying an EV, you would have
to fit certain eligibility requirements. For example, the car has to be below a
certain sticker price and assembled in the US, among other things. However, there was a workaround a
manufacturer could still offer the credit if the buyer leased the vehicle. The lease rates on those cars have just
absolutely skyrocketed this year, which is the interesting sort of knock
on effect in the used market, is that means that three years from now, a ton
of them start showing up in the used market. Skeptics like Karl Brauer think that
more will really need to change before the used car market looks more like its
internal combustion counterpart. So they need to cost as much as
combustion engines. They need to travel as far as
combustion engines, and they need to refuel as quickly as combustion
engines. When EVs can do those three things, why
would you not buy an EV? In addition, larger economic factors
like high interest rates would need to change. The factors that are in place, which is
a budding oversupply of new EVs, which is making them less
valuable and pushing their prices down, and economic concerns and high interest
rates. I don't see any of those changing in
the next few months, so there's no reason to believe in the near term at
least, that you would suddenly see a reverse in used EV pricing. A spike in gas prices could also spur
demand, but under certain conditions, interest in hybrids and EVs tends to
rise when gas prices are rising, but level off when prices settle, even if
the price is high. Understanding the used EV market and EV
depreciation presents serious challenges. First, the dataset is
small. As mentioned, only a tiny share of all
used cars are EVs. Second, because the market is still new
and the technology changes rapidly, there are still unknowns. Battery technology is one such area. It's something people worry about
because they're like, you know, my iPhone is down to 80% after two years,
what's going to happen to my car? So it's one of these things that may be
more of a consumer perception thing in real life. I mean, what we're seeing
with Teslas is the batteries do tend to go 7 or 8 years and are still pretty
good at the end of that. The short story on battery longevity is
that EV batteries are holding up better than people's expectations. It is not the case that an EV is an
iPhone with wheels on it. It doesn't work the same way, but there
is variability between different cars of the same make, model and year. And that's especially true as vehicles
age. So if you start out with a car that has
a range of 250 miles, after five years, it could have a range of
200 or 220, depending on how it's used, how it's charged, what weather
conditions it's exposed to. A simple change in federal tax credit
rules can lead to a flood of used vehicles three years down the road and
just one manufacturer, Tesla, can move the entire market just by changing
prices on its website. This is still a new market. We are still figuring out how EVs at
scale work. We are still figuring out how charging
at scale works. It's all these little things. People are doing this stuff for the
first time, used EVs that aren't Teslas are a new thing to some extent. Use. Teslas are still a new thing, and
we're all still learning how this is going to work. It's all still emerging.
