[♪♪♪] >> Andrew: YOU'RE AT THE GYM.  YOU ARE PUMPING IRON, GETTING  FIT, MINDING YOUR OWN BUSINESS  AND THEN COMES A GROUP OF  SOLDIERS, CHECKING EVERYONE'S  PAPERS MAKING SURE THEY'RE NOT  SUPPOSE TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES OF AN ONGOING WAR.  WE'VE SEEN PLENTY OF VIDEOS LIKE THIS.  UKRAINIAN CITIZENS, ALWAYS MEN,  SOMETIMES SIMPLY APPROACHED,  OTHER TIMES FORCIBLY TAKEN BY  MILITARY RECRUITERS DESPERATELY  TRYING TO FILL THE RANKS OF A  DEPLETED WAR EFFORT AGAINST  RUSSIA.  IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW OFTEN  THESE HAPPEN OR HOW FAR THEY  TYPICALLY GO BUT UKRAINE'S  PRESIDENT JUST SIGNED INTO LAW A CHANGE THAT WOULD WIDEN THE NET  RECRUITERS CAN CAST.  IT LOWERS THE MINIMUM AGE FROM  27 TO 25 AND WHAT'S REALLY  SURPRISING ABOUT THAT IS FOR  ALMOST A FULL YEAR, THIS LAW HAS BASICALLY BEEN SITTING ON  ZELENSKYY'S DESK WAITING TO BE  SIGNED.  UKRAINE'S PARLIAMENT PASSED IT  IN MAY OF LAST YEAR, BUT THE  IDEA OF LOWERING THE  CONSCRIPTION AGE IS SO VOLATILE, SO TOXIC IN WHAT IS NOW A TWO  YEAR WAR OF ATTRITION, ZELENSKYY DIDN'T WANT TO TOUCH IT BUT THE  INCREASINGLY DESPERATE STATE OF  THE WAR HAS FORCED HIS HAND.  >> UKRAINE IS GOVERNED BY A RULE OF LAW AND THEY HAVE TO BE  SENSITIVE ABOUT HOW THE CITIZENS FEEL ABOUT THE WAR.  THAT'S WHY THERE IS A HESITATION TO DECLARE MOBILIZATION.  >> Andrew: DOES THIS SOLVE  UKRAINE'S PROBLEM OF REPLACING  THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF  SOLDIERS WHO DIED AND MANY TIMES THAT NUMBER INJURED? OR DOES IT CREATE NEW PROBLEMS  THAT UKRAINE UNIQUELY MAY BE ILL EQUIP TO HANDLE.  LET'S TRY TO UNDERSTAND.  RIGHT NOW, THE UKRAINIAN STORY  IS ONE OF ENDURANCE.  >> SADLY THERE IS A FEELING OF  GRIM NECESSITY.  MOBILIZATION IS ESSENTIAL.  PEOPLE NEED TO FIGHT.  SOME OF THEM WILL DIE, BUT IN  UKRAINE, IT'S GENERALLY  RECOGNIZED THAT THE ALTERNATIVE  IS WORSE.  >> Andrew: RECALL IN HOW THE  FIRST FEW WEEKS OF RUSSIA'S  INVASION, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  OF UKRAINIANS VOLUNTEERED TO  DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY.  AS THE WAR DRAGGED ON AND  THECOUNTEROFFENSIVE STALLED,  THINGS CHANGED.  >> THEY DESCRIBED THE BATTLE AS  BEING STUCK IN A STALEMATE. >> THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY WILL  NOT ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL OF  BREAKING THE RUSSIAN LAND BREAK  TO CRIMEA BEFORE WINTER COMES  IN.  >> Andrew: THE MAN THAT WAS THE  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF UKRAINE'S  ARMY.  WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE  SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE ENJOYED BY THE ENEMY MOBILIZING HUMAN  RESOURCES AND HOW THAT COMPARES  WITH THE INABILITY OF STATE  INSTITUTIONS IN UKRAINE TO  IMPROVE THE MANPOWER LEVELS OF  OUR ARMED FORCES WITHOUT THE USE OF UNPOPULAR MEASURES.  TRANSLATION, RUSSIA IS DOING IT  RIGHT.  UKRAINE IS UNABLE TO DO WHAT IS  NECESSARY TO GET MORE MEN ON THE FRONT LINES.  THAT'S A PRETTY SCATHING THING  TO SAY COMING FROM THE  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF UKRAINE'S  ARMY.  HE GOT FIRED.  UKRAINE IS FACING THIS VERY REAL PROBLEM OF HOW DO WE REPLACE ALL OF OUR SOLDIERS WHO DIED.  ABOUT A MONTH AGO, ZELENSKYY  SAID UKRAINE LOST 31,000  SOLDIERS IN THE WAR.  NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW ACCURATE  THAT IS.  LAST SUMMER, U.S. OFFICIALS  QUOTED BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES"  PUT THE NUMBER CLOSER TO 70,000. RUSSIAN OFFICIALS MAYBE  UNSURPRISINGLY SAID THE TRUE  NUMBER IS SEVERAL TIMES EVEN  THAT.  NONE OF THIS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT  THE NUMBER WOUNDED, WHICH IN WAR IS ALWAYS SEVERAL TIMES THE  NUMBER OF DEAD.  POINT BEING MANY OF THE SOLDIERS WHO INITIALLY SIGNED UP FOR THE  WAR ARE EITHER DEAD, HURT, OR  EXHAUSTED.  THE POOL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT  TO BACK THEM UP IS BOTH SMALLER  AND MORE RELUCTANT.  >> FROZEN WAR, I AM VERY ATRADE   -- AFRAID TO HELP THE FROZEN  WAR.  >> THE INITIAL ENTHUSIASM AND  ENERGY IS WEARING OFF AND THERE  IS THE REALIZATION OF THE GRIM  STRUGGLE AHEAD.  >> Andrew: UKRAINE IS LIKE A LOT OF POST SOVIET COUNTRIES IN THAT AFTER THE SOVIET UNION BROKE UP, THOSE COUNTRIES WENT THROUGH A  GREAT DEAL OF ECONOMIC  HARDSHIPS.  THE '90s WERE TOUGH IN UKRAINE,  LEADING TO A DECLINE IN THE  BIRTHRATE AND ALL THESE YEARS  LATER, WE CAN SEE THAT.  THE NUMBER OF 20-YEAR-OLDS, IT'S THE SMALLEST DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE  COUNTRY.  MILITARY ANALYSTS PUT THE  AVERAGE AGE OF UKRAINIAN  SOLDIERS ON THE FRONT LINE AT  40-PLUS.  >> IT'S A PITY.  >> Andrew: THIS NEW LAW  MOBILIZING 25 AND 26-YEAR-OLDS  PUTS A FURTHER SQUEEZE ON THIS  RELATIVELY SMALL AGE GROUP.  >> THOSE 25 TO 30 YEARS OLD ARE  OF THE GENERATION WHERE THERE  ARE FEWER PEOPLE BEING BORN TO  FILLET BOAR PLACES.  THAT IS WHY THIS WILL HIT HARD  DEMOGRAPHICALLY.  >> Andrew: THEY HAD NEARLY  800,000 TROOPS.  IF YOU INCLUDE THE NATIONAL  GUARD AND OTHER UNITS, YOU MAY  APPROACH 1 MILLION UKRAINIANS IN UNIFORM.  >> THIS LATEST CHANGE MAY SEEM  LIKE NOT A LARGE DISTINCTION  BETWEEN LOWERING THE AGE FROM 27 TO 25, ONLY TWO YEARS  DIFFERENCE, BUT IT BRINGS IN  OTHER COHORTS AS WELL.  THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS BEING  ABOLISHED SUCH AS HAVING  MULTIPLE CHILDREN OR SPECIFIC  HEALTH CONDITIONS.  IT CASTS THE NET HIGHER FOR  PEOPLE TO BE TRAINED UP AND SENT TO THE FRONT LINES.  >> Andrew: THERE IS ALSO A  FINANCIAL BURDEN THAT COMES WITH MOBILIZING A LARGER ARMY.  THAT'S FEWER PEOPLE WORKING IN  THE LABOUR FORCE, EARNING MONEY, PAYING TAXES, SUPPORTING A  LARGER MILITARY FORCE.  AS WE BEGIN THE THIRD YEAR OF  WAR, ONLINE AND IN MAJOR CITIES, YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THE  MILITARY'S PITCH, CALLING FOR  SACRED REVENGE, THE HOLY  VICTORY.  >> Andrew: UKRAINE IS STRUGGLING TO CONVINCE ITS CITIZENS THAT  THIS IS A FIGHT STILL WORTH  SIGNING UP FOR.  UKRAINE HAS BEEN UNDER A STATE  OF MARBLE LAW SINCE THE WAR  BEGAN.  IT FORE BIDS MOST MEN BETWEEN 18 AND 60 FROM LEAVING UKRAINE,  UNLESS THEY ARE ALREADY EXEMPT  FROM MILITARY SERVICE.  THAT HASN'T STOPPED THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIANS FROM TRYING TO LEAVE. >> LIKE OTHERS, THEY DECIDED TO  LEAVE UKRAINE BEFORE THEY COULD  GET SWEPT UP INTO A WAR THEY  DON'T WANT TO FIGHT IN.  >> EVERY MAN NEEDS TO HAVE A  CHOICE, YOU KNOW.  >> Andrew: BRIAR STEWART HAS  DONE EXCELLENT WORK ON THIS  STORY AND I'LL LINK HER STORY IN THE DESCRIPTION.  SHE TRAVELLED TO MOLDOVA, WHICH  IS JUST BESIDE UKRAINE.  SHE SAID THERE 15,000 UKRAINIANS HAVE FLED ON FOOT SINCE THE WAR  BEGAN.  >> DID YOU FEEL GUILTY AT ALL  FOR LEAVING? >> NO.  >> Andrew: IF YOU COUNT THOSE  FLEEING TO OTHER NEIGHBOURING  COUNTRIES, THE NUMBER OF  PEOPLE'S CAPING THE PROSPECT OF  BEING CONSCRIPTED IS LIKELY IN  THE TENS OF THOUSANDS.  THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF  HEADLINES OF THE LENGTHS IN  WHICH PEOPLE WILL GO TO ESCAPE  MILITARY SERVICE.  ONE RECRUITER, ACCORDING TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES," SAID A QUARTER  OF POTENTIAL CONSCRIPTS  REPORTING TO HIS OFFICE WOULD  PAY A BRIBE.  THE GOING RATE, $1,000 FOR A WAY OUT.  I HAVE SEEN REPORTS OF BRIBES  FAR EXCEEDING EVEN THAT.  ACCORDINGLY MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS  SKYROCKETED LAST YEAR, ABOUT  TENFOLD ACCORDING TO UKRAINE'S  PRESIDENT.  NOW I SHOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF UKRAINIANS STILL BELIEVE IN  VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY AND THE SAME MAJORITY SUPPORTS THE WAR  EFFORT, BUT HIS APPROVAL RATINGS HAVE DROPPED STEADILY IN THE  LAST YEAR AND SIGNING UP FOR THE WAR IS SENSITIVE.  THERE IS ACTUALLY A TOUGHER LAW  MAKING THROUGH UKRAINE'S  PARLIAMENT THAT TOUGHENS  PENALTIES AND EXPANDS THE NET OF WHO CAN BE DRAFTED EVEN FURTHER. JUST SO YOU HAVE AN IDEA HOW  CONTENTIOUS THAT IDEA IS, AT ONE POINT IT HAD OVER 4,000 PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.  >> MOBILIZATION IS SO  POLITICALLY SENSITIVE IN  UKRAINE, IT'S ONE OF THE  INDICATORS OF HOW THESE ARE TWO  VERY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AT WAR  WITH EACH OTHER.  IN RUSSIA, THERE IS NO SUCH  CONVERSATION.  THEY FOUND IT EASY TO SWEEP  PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS, TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE PRISONS IN ORDER TO FIND MORE BODIES TO THROW TO  THE FRONT LINES.  >> Andrew: THERE ARE MANY  MOTHERS AND WIVES STILL WAITING  FOR THEIR SONS AND HUSBANDS TO  BE DEMOBILIZED, BROUGHT BACK,  AND REPLACED ON THE FRONT LINE  AFTER TWO YEARS OF FIGHTING,  TRUST -- FRUSTRATED THAT SO FEW  ARE TAKING THEIR POSITIONS.  AT A WAR WHERE SUPPORT IS IN  SHORT SUPPLY, THERE ARE MANY IN  UKRAINE WHO WONDER WHAT FUTURE  THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR IF THERE  IS A CHANCE THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN  SURVIVE TO SEE IT.  [♪♪♪]
