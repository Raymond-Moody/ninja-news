THAT MONEY IS STILL GOING IN AND IT'S FINDING HOMES AND BOOSTING PARTS OF THE ECONOMY. >> FOR MORE ON THE MARKETS BRING IN JPMORGAN'S ASSET MANAGEMENT CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST DAVID KELLY JOINS US AT POST NINE IN THE WAKE OF THE JOBS NUMBER. HAPPY FRIDAY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE SIGNS OF A COOLING LABOR MARKET AT LEAST AFTER JOLTS AND SOME OF THE WAGE NUMBERS TODAY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? >> WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU TAKE COOKIES OUT OF THE OVEN. THEY'RE COOLING BUT COOLING SLOWLY. THAT'S OKAY. THIS IS REALLY VERY GOOD NEWS. WE'VE GOT 27 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS NOW WHERE THE S&P IS AT OR BELOW 20%. THAT'S THE LONGEST STRETCH SINCE THE 1960s. IT'S VERY GOOD. ONE OF THE WEIRD THINGS I THINK IS GOING ON, WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE UPSIDE IMMIGRATION BECAUSE OF THE CHAOTIC WAY PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY BUT THERE WERE MORE THAN 2 MILLION JOB AUTHORIZATIONS BY THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES LAST -- IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR UP FROM 1.2 THE YEAR BEFORE. ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE APPLIED FOR ASYLUM ARE NOT GOING TO GET A HEARING FOR FIVE YEARS, BUT WITHIN SIX MONTHS, THEY'RE ELIGIBLE TO WORK. I THINK THAT'S BEGINNING TO FILL SOME OF THE GAPS WE'RE SEEING PARTICULARLY IN LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY AND RETAIL. THOSE JOB OPENINGS HAVE COME BACK DOWN TO PREPANDEMIC LEVELS. A BIG ISSUE IN HEALTH CARE AND MORE SKILLED AREAS, BUT WE ARE SEEING EMPLOYMENT GROWTH, LABOR FORCE GROWTH COMING PARTLY BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION. >> THAT GOT REFLECTED IN CBO DATA IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS. >> MEANTIME THESE PRODUCTIVE NUMBERS, A DESK NOTE OUT OF JPMORGAN THAT SAYS THIS IS A DISCUSSION POINT NOW FOR CLIENTS, THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN LET THE ECONOMY RUN AND STILL KEEP UNEMPLOYMENT BELOW 4. >> THAT'S RIGHT. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAGE DATA, THE WAGE DATA FOR JANUARY WERE DISTORTED BY WEATHER. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS FROM FEBRUARY. 4.3% YEAR OVER YEAR WAGE GROWTH. IT'S A LITTLE ON THE HOT SIDE. 2% INFLATION F YOU CAN DO 2% PRODUCTIVITY AND GOODS PRICES, YOU CAN DO 4% WAGE GROWTH AND EVERYTHING STAYS STABLE. WE CAN DO GOOD WAGE GROWTH IN THIS ECONOMY, AND STILL GET TO 2% INFLATION. WHICH IS A VERY GOOD OUTCOME. >> WHERE ARE YOU? JUNE FOR THE FIRST CUT AND HOW MANY? IT'S STILL GOING TO BE A CAREFUL ART HERE. >> I THINK SO. IT'S A TRICKY BIT OF ACROBATICS HERE. WE THINK THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CUTRATES 25 BASIS POINTS IN JUNE, 25 IN SEPTEMBER, 25 IN DECEMBER AT THOSE S&P MEET WHERE IS THEY'RE GIVING OUT INFORMATION. THEY'LL TAKE IT SLOWLY. LONG MAY THIS LAST BECAUSE, OF COURSE, NOT ONLY GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY BUT GOOD FOR INVESTORS. THIS IS WHAT'S SUPPORTING A CONTINUED RALLY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THE FACT THAT WAGE GROWTH IS NOT EXPLODING, IS ALSO HELPING THE INTEREST RATES FROM NOT GOING HIGHER. >> AT THIS POINT WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS AROUND EARNINGS, GIVEN HERE WE CAME IN AGAIN AND WE GOT SURPRISED ON BETTER ECONOMIC DATA? >> WELL, YES, BUT THE EARNINGS ARE GOING TO BE -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO MATCH THE ANALYST EXPECTATIONS. THE ANALYSTS ARE LOOKING FOR DOUBLE DIGITS THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR. I THINK WE'LL GET MID SINGLE DIGIT BUT IF WE HAVE OVER 4% WAGE GROWTH AND SLOWING NOMINAL GROWTH, WHICH I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON, IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT HARD TO HIT THE TARGETS. TARGETS ARE AT VERY HIGH LEVELS AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK IF WE CAN JUST DO MID-SINGLE DIGITAL EARNINGS GROWTH THAT'S REALLY FINE. I STILL THINK THERE ARE PARTS OF THE EQUITY MARKET WHICH ARE OVERPRICED AT THIS POINT, BUT PEOPLE TEND TO KEEP ON MAKING BIGGER BETS FURTHER OUT AS WE GET SHOCKED. THEY NEED TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THE NEXT SHOCK COULD REALLY,
