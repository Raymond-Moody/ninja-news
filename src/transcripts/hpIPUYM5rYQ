hello everyone welcome back to the channel I hope you're doing well today I thought we'd have a look at an article I saw in the Daily Mail once again everyone seems to enjoy these kind of Market updates finding out what's going on with the market and this one particularly caught my eye because it is how dramatically EV cars are falling in value the title of the article is the 30 used EVS that have plunged most in value in 2023 with some year old cars worth only half as much it's got the top 30 cars in here but I'm going to skip through go straight to the top 10 because some of them are ridiculous I mean if you're interested in seeing 30 to number 11 pause the screen here and you will see that so before we get into exactly which cars are Fallen the most I think we'll probably just stick to the top 10 and how much they've Fallen by you know why have EVS dropped so much it says this year has been a turbulent one for used electric vehicles the value of secondhand battery cars has taken a battering as result of falling demand increasing Supply entering the market and more appealing deals on the brand new electric models as such some have seen their secondhand prices compared to 12 months earlier slashed almost in half it goes on to say the used EV Market took its downward turn in October 2022 and for much of this year has hurtled into a descent that has cost owners thousands of pounds if they opted to sell now instead of 12 months earlier this is a result of what it calls The Perfect Storm the combined toll includes the spending impact of the cost living crisis Skyhigh Energy prices fresh scrutiny of electric cars in mainstream media and oversupply of E's entering the used market and Tesla's decision to Slash new model prices at the beginning of the year there's quite a few different things in here from cap hbi who kind of as we've talked about in previous videos give us the values for cars trade-wise what things are selling for kind of gives you an idea of what cars are valued at currently and they're go on to say they're seen a drop off in demand due to cost cost of electricity uh particularly at nonh homebased charge points some range anxiety and generally the more more complicated ownership of an EV compared to ice being internal combustion engine Darren Martin of cap HPI says the worst looks to be over for used EVS though with secondhand prices now starting to level out having enjoed a year of spiraling I guess I'm not really in the market for EVS I'm not really a fan of them in general I've tried to stock a few now and they just sit around forever I'm sure if you're a specialist in electric vehicles you can do well with them but for me I'm not really willing to adopt that as part of a business model just yet I'd rather stick to internal combustion engine cars CU I know more about them and electric vehicles are just a bit of a headache people want to ask me questions about electric vehicles what would the range be in this what about the weather what about I just don't have the experience to be confident enough to give people sensible answers that doesn't sound like I'm just making things up so that definitely put me off as far as only one I wouldn't mind it I wouldn't be particularly happy about the charging but I'm sure if I looked into it I could find way way that would work well the bulk majority of my driving is short distance so it wouldn't matter but if I wanted to do longer Journeys For Me luckily I could take another car but if I had to do lots of charging stopping off it would just be a pain in the bum really obviously over the last couple of years prices of cars seem to have been going up the same of EVS to start off with and I think now that supply for those has caught up that there is more of a demand to shift into something new it's one of those markets I guess electric vehicles where improvements are made so quickly it's in the early days that once you've had a car for a few years and it is a few years old maybe the battery's deteriorating a little bit it's just a completely different animal from the newest electric vehicle out therefore you know it's just not worth as much and you want to be in the new car obviously I can't purport to know an awful lot about electric vehicles as I say but I am Keen to look at how much electric vehicle Pioneers have lost by having bought their EV so in at number 10 is the Renault Zoey funny enough those of you who follow me on Instagram might have seen I put up a short video on this watching a first generation Renault Zoe going through and it was a cap clean of what it should be like a current auction price trade price of about £5,000 I think and they struggled to get £25,000 for it again it's got a least battery which makes things just another complication you have to understand I think in many senses having a least battery is actually a good thing because they will replace it if it deteriorates during that time but it's just an added complication it just another thing to wrap your head around so in it number 10 is the Renault Zoe the 2019 model until present and that is apparently down by 39% the average used price at the start of 2023 was $2,089 and the average used price at the end of 2023 12,254 meaning an average price fall of 7,836 there's a bit of information about the Rena Zoe here which if you want to check that out you can on The Daily Mail website but then we roll on to number nine which is the voxal corser E 2019 to present that is down 39.3% average used price at the start of 23 was £ 22447 and the average use price at the end of 2023 was 13 , 631 that is an average price fall of £ 8,816 he goes on to say despite the cost of being one of the more popular cars on the road it hasn't really helped as far as this electric version goes so number eight is the Mazda mx30 2020 model till present that's down 40% the average used price at the start of 23 23,63070 end of 23 $4,175 meaning an average price fall of 9,438 that's uh losing nearly half the value of the car there again there's a bit of information about this the most surprising thing is that's got a range of 124 miles pointless ridiculous surely then in at number seven is the Nissan Leaf the 2017 model onwards down 40.2% average used price at the start 23 24775 at the end of 23 14861 that is an average price for of 9,914 obviously the leaf was an early adopter to electric vehicles incredibly popular but still down an awful lot in value in at number six is the jaguar ipace that is the 2018 model onwards that is down 40.4% average used price at the start at 23 £ 52,6 average price at the end of 23 £ 31,50 that means in 2023 on average they fell by 2,010 that is quite a blow doesn't help I suppose that it is a premium car which seem to have taken a bit of a downward turn at the moment as well as being electric vehicle which have also taking a downward turn it's a double blow for this car in at number five is the voxal mo ke that's the 2020 model until present and that is down by 40.8% average price at the start of 23 26961 at the end of 231 15,950 that is an average price fall in 2023 of £ 11,011 doesn't seem so bad when you look at it from the ipace but actually as a percentage obviously it's down by more as far as EVS go I think that's quite smart looking it doesn't shout the fact that it's an eeve necessarily it's still got a grill on the front they never seem to know what to do seeing as they don't need a radiated Grill but uh yeah I thought that's quite a smart thing but still losing a lot of money now before we get into the top four I just want to take a chance to speak about today's video sponsor which is a vehicle score if you're looking to buy a used car whether it be an EV or ice internal combustion engine I highly recommend vehicle score they do a free vehicle check give you loads of information about that car make sure you're not buying a lemon so if I head to vehicle score .co.uk I'm going to enter the registration we've just seen which is L1 VXL this is a voxal press registration so it might not still be registered on a mocker and let's find out when we put it in unsurprisingly it's 999 top marks because this is going to be a practically brand new car uh yeah it says it's an Astra so I imagine it's on one of their electric astras now but if you're looking at a used car you can scroll down it'll tell you whether the car's taxed whether it's gotot currently it's saying mot state is no details held by DV because it's not had its first mot yet if it had you can go through the mot history you can check the mileage checker on older cars there's information about things you should look out for when you're buying a used one as well as a host of other information that's just incredibly useful and when it comes to handing over your hard ear cash for a used car it always pays to do a vehicle history check and vehicle score I've got you covered for that as well you can either do their 297 Salvage plus report their ultimate report for only £897 or for extra peace of mind you can do that ultimate report which is ensured that's only 997 and gives you £10,000 worth of Experian data guarantee so should there be any discrepancies between what the report says and how the car ends up being you're insured you're covered it's just peace of mind I highly recommend always doing a history check of some kind on a car before you buy it because a lot of cars have a hidden history and if you are going to use vehicle score make sure you use my discount code shifting metal 20 this will give you 20% off and if you apply that to the ultimate insured report that is going to make it just £7.98 saving you just under 2 quid which I think is well worth having thank you vehicle score for sponsoring this video let's check out number four then in at number three is the mercedesbenz eqa that's the 2021 model onwards down by 41.2% average used price at the start of 2023 was £ 46,5 25 at the end of 2023 that was £ 27375 meaning an average fall over the year of 9,150 serious amounts of money being lost on these EVS that is a terrifying I mean I don't think I've ever even spent £19,000 on a car for myself maybe close but to lose that in a year would make me sick it goes on to say this is the cheapest of the EQ models but it's actually quite good with a 311 mile range which seems far more practical than a lot of these cars like that Mazda that had 124 mile range what is the point of that moving swiftly on then to number three which is the Mercedes-Benz eqc that's the 2019 model onwards and that is down by 41.2% average used price at the start of 23 was 58,800 was £ 34,653 average price fall on a like for like car just a year apart £4,250 down terrifying that's again like half the value basically and on top of that if you chosen that model because you just liked it that little bit extra than the eqa not only have you lost more money it didn't even have as much range this only does 259 mil to a charge rather than 311 number two is the Volkswagen e up I don't know whether have an exclamation mark on the E up like they do on the up which tends to confuse a lot of our customers who think it's either an up e or an up exclamation mark just just make it an up the average use price for one of these at the beginning of 23 with 10,000 M the clock £ 2,450 and at the end of 23 with 10,000 M on a clock 12,300 it's an average price for of 9,150 they go on to say it's one of the smaller e on the road and actually still has a fairly decent range considering that of 159 Mi which is better than that Master thing but it still dropped an awful lot so our number one Faller in 2023 as far as electric vehicles go was the seat Mi electric that's a 2019 to 2022 model down 45.6% we used one of those of 10,000 Mi at the beginning of 2023 would have cost you 18,650 quid at the end of 23 with the same amount amount of miles on it would have been £1,150 giving you an average price for in 2023 of £82 grand you could have got yourself a good few very nice holidays with that couldn't you strangely that is basically just an up isn't it or an e up so why that fell particularly is it just the brand Prestige cuz it's essentially the same car I mean look at them they are one and the same with different grills and a different badge on it I imagine they perform very similarly this says it's got a range of 62 Mi so somehow this one's got 3 m more than the vwe up but still it's lost even more money so there we have it that is the top 10 biggest fallers in EV value out there do you own one of these cars have you lost out do you think prices have actually settled down now and are you considering buying one I'm still not getting involved yet until they've got a decent range in them there's enough people out there who can service them know how to work on them we stopped stop hearing about things where they've set on fire and those sorts of things before I decide that it's going to be a car for me but as always I would love to hear from you in the comments so make sure you drop a comment down below if you enjoyed
