all right well the US added 303,000 jobs in the month of March well that was well above the Street's expectations now City saying in a recent note that they expected the job market to weaken with just 150,000 jobs added in March leading to 125 basis points of cuts this year almost double what the market is currently pricing in so where do things stand following this higher than expected uh jobs print that we got out this morning we want to bring in one of the economists behind that call you have Andrew Hollen horse he's a city a chief us Economist Andrew it's great to see you here so first just your reaction to the print that we got out this morning and whether or not that changes your base case for the fed and the degree of the cuts that you are expecting this year yeah this was a much stronger than expected jobs report like you said stronger than our forecast stronger than consensus forecast I don't know that it changes that much for the FED at the end of the day um or that we should be changing our forecast at city and I'll explain why from the fed's perspective this is exactly the kind of jobs report that they want to see like you explained very strong job growth but not a pickup in inflationary pressure to the extent that it would concern fed officials what we've seen from the FED recently is a real tolerance for somewhat stronger wage growth somewhat stronger price growth to your point year- on-year inflation readings year-on-year wage growth readings are coming down that's going to keep the FED encourage that we can actually run this stronger job growth and it's not going to lead to a re acceleration in inflation now is that something they should be worried about I think they should be but if you've listened to the recent fed rhetoric they're really pushing a narrative that the potential of the US economy is greater and that potential job growth is higher so that you can have these jobs numbers and you can still have the FED on course to cut rates later this year um we haven't heard from fed officials after the report I think when we do what we'll hear is that they still think they're on that path to Cuts well you made up an interesting point that Muhammad alaran kind of mentioned this morning saying that the FED is sort of acting like I'm I'm extrapolating here but like a sports commentator they're just commenting on the data as it comes in they don't have this Central thesis driving them but it sounds like you might be picking up on some sort of central thesis from them that you might disagree with can you spell that out for me a bit more yeah I think where the FED has been and and and I would agree with um Muhammad alian on this is that the FED has been very very reactive to each data point um and that kind of happened throughout 2022 even into 2023 as the inflation readings just kept coming in stronger than expected and what they're trying to shift to now I think is a kind of consensus around the idea that in their view interest rates are restrictive at these levels and if they don't begin bringing down interest rates that will slow the economy later in the future so they need to start bringing in interest rates down now to prevent that slow that could happen in the future I think that's where they are as a committee but there are two risks to that like you point out one risk is that you cut rates too early and that re accelerates inflation and we have a lot of signs that inflation is really not getting back to 2% it looks a lot stickier around 3% um there's also a risk to the other side of the Mandate the employment side of the Mandate now you're certainly not seeing it in the jobs figures today very strong hiring a low unemployment rate but when you look at some of this data in detail you see things like the unemployment rate that yes it's low but it's risen almost half a percentage point and when you get this kind of gentle slowing in the labor market especially when you might have some labor hoarding that's going on people had trouble hirings they're reluctant to fire now firms are reluctant to engage in those layoffs you can have a quick shift towards layoffs so you really want to be careful with this labor market data yes in terms of where we are today very strong in terms of where we're going there's still a lot of open questions Andrew the FED does not cut three times or cut what your base case is 125 basis points of cuts here before the end of the year what is that then talk to us just about the risk that that poses to the economy the likelihood of a recession the weakness that we could see in the jobs market and then further what that would tell us just about the overall pressure for the US economy going forward well this is what's so difficult for fed officials to manage is you do have these long and variable lags is the term that always gets used in terms of the effect of monetary policy on the economy so interest rates are high they've been high for some time inflation has come down which means real interest rates have actually increased that is exerting more and more of a restrictive power on the economy at some point that is going to slow the economy down if you just leave interest rates at a restrictive level for too long um then you will slow the economy perhaps more than what's necessary to bring down inflation on the other hand if you look at the data today well the activity data are all holding up jobs data is holding up and inflation is running above Target so you know just based on kind of the the data that we got this morning for instance you would say why why cut interest rates there should be no rush to cut interest rates but if you think about where we might be going then that creates an argument for cutting interest rates and the FED is trying to get that balance exactly right that's their job that's of course what they're going to try to do the reality is that historically central banks do not get that balance right sometimes it's impossible to get that balance right it may be that there is no path to 2% inflation that doesn't involve unemployment going higher so this brings up a really difficult point then about how challenging this is for the Federal Reserve and we've been talking about how the road to 2% would get harder as it went along and J pal certainly talked about that as well but given what you just mentioned is there a reason for them to cut with inflation still looking hotter than expected in this jobs print as of this morning yeah so I mean if you if you look at the most recent data on inflation it really hasn't been encouraging of this idea that inflation had just slowed down um at the end of last year that story looked a lot more encouraging where you had six-month core pce and I think there was maybe a little bit too much emphasis on that one measure that had gotten down below 2% and fed officials were looking at that and I think they were really thinking maybe we really have this off Landing here maybe we don't want to say it publicly but but maybe we've kind of really achiev achieve that and now it's just a question of kind of you when do we actually get these Cuts going if we if we've landed the economy softly then we can start to normalize interest rates there's a much bigger question now about whether inflation is really coming down I think it has become a lot more clear uh to markets to Fed officials to analysts that there is a Last Mile problem here that it will be difficult to bring inflation down and by the FED Zone forecast they have inflation closer to 3% at the end of this year than to 2% at least on a core pce basis um yet they still plan to cut in that scenario that's this difficult balance between supporting employment um but also trying to be attentive to your price stability Target yeah Andrew speaking a little bit more about that last Mile in terms of taming inflation you've got wage growth yes improved a bit when you talk about that drop on from what we saw the previous month but still strong you've got oil prices Maddie was just discussing this massive move up that we've seen in crude and Brent is that going do you think to contribute to the difficulty here for the fed and trying to tame inflation and almost keep inflation moving sideways here for some time yeah what we're seeing with Goods inflation with oil prices that could be a real headache for fed officials the way we got down to that 2% inflation on a six-month basis where we were at the end of last year was largely through Goods price disinflation and now that we're starting to see some of these potential supply chain disruptions again um and just this move higher in energy price prices that we've seen most recently uh we shouldn't expect that disinflation to continue and if anything you could have some upside risk to goods and on the other hand the domestically determined inflation particularly in the non- shelter Services that's going to be very responsive to wages and I think you described the data exactly correctly there that yes wage growth has slowed but wage growth is still running stronger than it did pre pandemic of course wage growth is a good thing for employees the issue is when that wage growth feeds into higher prices from firms and you're kind of stuck in the scenario where wages are running higher and prices are running higher also and that's where we are right now sounds like not a lot of reason to cut other than the FED already telling us that they were going to Andrew thank you so much for joining us really appreciate it that was Andrew Hollen hor City chief us Economist on all things jobs data and more
