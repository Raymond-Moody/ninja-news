an AI tool being tested in Scotland has identified tiny breast cancer tumors in 11 women which had been missed by doctors the technology was piloted alongside National Health Service clinicians and analyzed the mammograms of more than 10,000 women are technology editor Zoe kimman has more details so this is one of the extra cancers that was picked up by the AI that is so tiny yes it is indeed and you can see why two human readers would have just looked through comp had it it looks very much the same I would have said that that's normal here in abedine Dr Gerald lip has just led the first NHS evaluation of an artificial intelligence tool called Mia designed to help improve breast cancer diagnosis the initial results are encouraging it's almost like another colleague and someone has a second sort of second opinion looking over your shoulder and helping you so one human reader and then the AI doing the next read we could turn move our turnaround time from 14 days down to 3 days and you know that anxiety if you've had a mamogram or any test in the hospital I've had tests you're kind of waiting on that result and you want to know it as soon as you can so anxiety and uh and sort of is another factor in this as well that we want to try and reduce Barbara's cancer was so tiny Dr lip and his team didn't spot it but Mia did I'm just incredibly grateful if I hadn't had that then I don't know when I would have found it the early diagnosis meant that Barbara needed shorter and less invasive treatment she told me without AI her tumor might not have been spotted for another 3 years at her next routine scan by which point it would have been a lot bigger and might have spread you say cancer and they say oh I'm so sorry and I felt a fraud because it was so small it's just so easy there's no extra appointment or anything and then when you have the operation it's at a very early stage so it's minimal compared to what it could be AI is good at this when it's properly trained to spot early tiny symptoms of a specific disease but this isn't perfect yet it has a tendency to overdiagnose and also because of current health guidelines it's not allowed to learn on the job and evolve as it's used right now this Tech is still being researched Mir was built by the medical firm Kieran and runs on computing power from Microsoft it was fed millions of images of scans from women around the world to enable it to recognize specific signs of potential breast cancer bre speaking within 5 years some experts say AI will routinely be used in cancer diagnosis I struggled to see some of the symptoms doctor lip showed me and I only looked at a few of them currently human Specialists analyze up to 10,000 scans per year the hope is that aite Tech like Mia might one day reduce that workload and the strain that goes with it Zoe Kleinman BBC News
