the covid-19 pandemic traumatized people and societies but it also spurred medical advances in a very big way perhaps nowhere as much as in the field of vaccines where a groundbreaking new platform based on molecules called messenger RNA saved millions of lives now the technology is coming into its own in other areas like the possible treatment for another killer pancreatic cancer the pancreas plays an important role in digestion and Metabolism a tumor there is bad news mortality rates in people who develop pancreatic cancer are very high so pancreatic cancer is so deadly because it starts to metastasize early on which means you must move out of the tumor microenvironment in the primary tumor location and start to migrate to other places in the body and this is extremely difficult to contain and means that the chances even after removal of the primary tumor that you have a recurrence and the recurrent disease pretty soon an mRNA cancer vaccine works by making the body aware of cancerous cells which are able to grow undetected by the immune system a dose of vaccine contains many copies of a short stretch of precise genetic information the messenger RNA it induces the body to start making specific proteins like ones found only on the surface of a cancer cell after being trained by the vaccine to recognize the cancer cells the alerted immune system defense cells attack them wherever they are the big hurdle is that because every patient's cancer is different their cancer-specific proteins are also highly individual so every mRNA vaccine has to be specifically produced for a particular patient the advances in genomics and in being able to identify potentially highly immunogenic antigens that are quite unique to the patients themselves giving it a personalized focus is is also a huge huge advance in a small-scale study recently published in the journal Nature researchers used custom-made messenger RNA vaccines as part of a pancreatic cancer treatment plan in around half the patients the individualized vaccine candidates based on technology developed by German firm biontech appeared to prevent a relapse of the disease for at least 18 months a larger trial is now slated to start this year the trial was a combination of three things of chemotherapy a checkpoint inhibitor and the vaccine and comparing it historically to just checkpoint and chemotherapy the results were much better but what we need to see a larger trial more patients and a double blind so compared to the the two versus plus vaccine to know that it it's it it it's truly effective if the new mRNA vaccine therapy does prove effective in larger efficacy trials it would be a huge step forward in combating one of the deadliest forms of cancer out there and joining me now to talk with us more about this was the man who produced that report Derek Williams uh Derek this all looks very promising uh what obstacles remain well um this was first of all it's important to say that this was really a small phase one trial so it wasn't looking at efficacy it wasn't looking at the effectiveness it was looking to check to see whether or not this kind of a treatment could be safe and feasible that said pancreatic cancer is a real killer with a with a very very high chance of relapse so the fact that after 18 months half of the 16 people who got who got this vaccine didn't relapse is actually pretty big news and they're planning much larger efficacy trials now to kick off at the end of the year in your assessment How likely is it that this will actually lead to successful treatment well we've learned a lot about messenger RNA in the last few years and and and really the the theory is very sound what you're doing is you're is you're using this molecule to kick-start your immune system and get it to do the heavy lifting and the healing process and and so the theory is very sound whether or not you're targeting something a particular Protein that's on the outside of a of a pathogen like source code V2 um the the virus that causes covid-19 or whether you're getting the immune system to recognize particular proteins that are on the outside of a cancer cell you're trying to warn the immune system in advance that this danger exists and so the theory is sound and and um yeah I think it's we've seen in some other trials with other types of cancer melanoma recently too that it they've had some success there so it's not necessarily going to be a knock down slam dunk but it's I think definitely going to be one tool in the shed as in as we move into the future what about costs because covet of course was a global problem and everyone is throwing money at it but you know pancreatic cancer that's something else can can this treatment do you think be made affordable well this is one of the things we hear about personalized Health Care over and over now this is personalized Healthcare at it's kind of an example of that what you have to do what they have to do is they have to go in and actually genomically sequence the tumor itself and then compare that genomic sequence to a healthy genomic sequence from that individual so you're having to go through jump through quite a few technical hoops and and and it's an expensive process the cost for genomic sequencing have come down quite dramatically in the last couple of decades as we get better and better at it but you still have to manufacture it and you have to do don't forget all of this stuff quite quickly because the chance of relapse is always there on the horizon so you want to get in and whack it as quickly as you possibly can after the surgery so um yeah I think that um it is going to be able to be affordable at some point if we get the manufacturing and the genomic sequencing infrastructure in place just quickly you know we've been talking about pancreatic cancer but could these kinds of therapeutic vaccines be used for other medical conditions as well certainly I mean they're they're looking at it in a whole range of infectious diseases and in a whole range of cancers I mentioned this this trial that went uh went on with melanoma quite recently so there's a lot there are dozens of Trials actually going on right now and um this is an area where really researchers are putting a lot of Hope for it in the future very exciting Derek thank you very much Derek
