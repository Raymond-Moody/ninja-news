Ukraine's president
is giving his strongest, starkest warning yet
about the state of the war against Russia without military aid
from the United States. Yet, sure, if Congress does not help
Ukraine, Ukraine, we lose the war and we need to find
a public format for this. If Ukraine loses
the war, other states would be attacked. Volodymyr Zelensky also says Russia will soon
be, quote, more and more insistent on dragging nuclear weapons
into his debate. Meanwhile, the head of the US House
Intelligence Committee says Russian propaganda has absolutely spread through Congress, particularly
among some of his Republican colleagues. A number of hardline House conservatives
have refused to back a $95 billion aid package, which includes 60 billion
in assistance for Ukraine. Joining me now from Vienna is Frances
O'Grady, an associate fellow at the International Institute
for Strategic Studies. I mean, it was very clear language,
wasn't it, from President Zelensky, but it's the sort of argument
that's been made in Washington for some time that all of those who feel
that Ukraine needs that money from the US Well, I think it's fair to assume
that we are currently in a transitional phase
when it comes to the war in Ukraine. Russia is conducting
probing attacks along the front line. It is trying to advance where it can
and it is preparing what seems to be a future offensive down the road. And this is of course very, very worrying
because Ukraine currently
is also already losing territory men. And the biggest handicap
that Ukraine currently has in its war against Russia is manpower. It is of course, related to ammunition,
but it's not exclusively the lack of Western support. I do want to emphasize this here using the war. How do you read that? Does that mean
Russia keeps the lines that it's got or that Russia continues
to take the rest of Ukraine Well, I think it would be premature to say
that Ukraine is losing this war. I think overall, yes, it is true
that there are certain negative trends that are ongoing in 20, 24 for Ukraine. But I also think at the same time,
this war is far from over or, you know, far from lost for Ukraine. The major issue here is manpower,
ammunition and Ukraine needs both in order
to at least hold on to what they are currently, you know, holding on along the front line. And so I think what we need
you should perhaps expect down the road
is some tactical withdrawals, some Russian advances, along parts of the front
line, perhaps even down the road, a partial collapse of certain sectors
of the Ukrainian front line. But this doesn't mean that Ukraine
is going to lose this war. It just means that we probably need to be
ready for some bad news down the road. But it's not indicative of Ukraine
losing the struggle in the long term. There's obviously been stepping up
as much as it can to fill the gap with potentially the gap with us
going into US money going into Ukraine, also coming out
with new plans for how that war could be supported from Europe,
taking some pressure off the United States Is there any way that Europe could replace
what America is giving right now? Well, not in the short term. In the long term, I think the situation
might look different. But this year, Ukraine really needs U.S. support there certain weapons
systems, certain logistical support, which the European countries
simply cannot provide to Ukraine. So U.S. aid remains crucial, particularly
when it comes to ammunition, when it comes to other weapons systems
such as infantry fighting vehicles, long range air defense systems in particular,
because if you've been following the news the last couple of weeks,
have seen an uptick in so-called quiet bomb attacks, which are really terrible
and and really causing a lot of havoc along the front line. And Ukraine desperately needs long range
air defense systems. And the United States is the only country
that can really supply those, for example. Obviously, Trump comes into this argument
because many of his supporters are very much against funding Ukraine. But when you look at the language of Trump, you know, he you know, it's
not entirely clear what he would actually do in a situation if you base it
on what you says ahead of it. But you think he's really saying
that he would stop funding Ukraine and stop supporting
Ukraine or is he? This is a bigger issue,
just that, you know, some European countries simply aren't
paying their fair share, a share in tomato I do think it's a wake up call for Europe on many, many fronts
when it comes to these comments by the former president
of the United States. Having said that, I do think the Europeans have realized that didn't need to step up,
that they need to do more. Whether it's enough, that remains to be seen for the moment,
there is no substitute for U.S. military aid. Unfortunately,
I also want to emphasize, though, that we need to decouple the discussion
about European Western American military aid to Ukraine
and to duration of this war, because the Ukrainians would continue
to fight even without any Western aid, because they simply have no choice
but to resist Russian aggression. Okay, friends suffocating. Thank you so much for joining
us with your insight today.
