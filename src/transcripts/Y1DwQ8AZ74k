My first thought was that
the report that came out this morning is pretty much in line with our
expectations. Our hand is a steady hand in this.
We've been saying all through last year and this year that we're making
progress. We've noted that progress.
We haven't overreacted to it. We didn't overreact to the good data we
had in the second half of last year. You heard us saying that this is good,
but we need to see more. And and you won't hear us overreacting
to these two months that are higher. The reason that's important is that the
decision to begin to reduce rates is a very, very important one, because the
risks are two sided. If we if we reduce rates too soon,
there's a chance that inflation would pop back and we'd have to come back in
and that would be very disruptive. That would not be a good thing for the
economy. There's also a risk that we would wait
too long and that that would we would, you know, in that case, it could be an
unnecessary, unneeded damage to the economy and perhaps the labor market.
The economy is strong. We see very strong growth.
We had growth for last year over 3%. Many forecasters see growth coming down
to around 2% this year. That that's about roughly what the first
quarter looks like. That means that we don't need to be in a
hurry to cut. It means we can wait and become more
confident that, in fact, inflation is coming down to 2% on a sustainable
basis. My own expectation is I don't think
rates will go back down to the very, very low levels they were at before the
pandemic. But where they will turn out to settle
out, it's hard to say it this this economy doesn't feel like it's suffering
from the current level of rates, although in if you look at things like
inflation sensitive spending, then those parts of the economy are really feeling
the high rates.
