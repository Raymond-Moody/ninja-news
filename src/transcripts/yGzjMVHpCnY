LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF REAL THINGS. HE'S THE BEST HE IS. >> RELY ON PHIL MORE THAN WE EVER HAVE. >>> LET'S START WITH THE MARKET, GET YOUR REACTION TO THE HOTTER THAN EXPECTED CPI PRINT. WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF EXPECTATIONS FOR A FED RATE CUT, WHICH ARE FADING FAST. THE YIELD CURVE INVERTING A BIT. THE TWO-YEAR MOVING UP MORE IN YIELD THAN THE TEN-YEAR RIGHT NOW. >> YOU START THINKING, WHY DID THE FED KIND OF COMMIT TO NEUTRALITY? THESE NUMBERS, WHAT WAS BAD WAS WORSE. WE'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT SHELTER FOR A LONG TIME, SHELTER GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. I THINK THE EMPLOYMENT NUMBER ON FRIDAY GAVE YOU A GOOD READ OF WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, THINGS THAT HAVE TO COST MORE. WE HAVE A SURGE IN PEOPLE WHO WORK IN TRAVEL AND LEISURE, SO OF COURSE, THOSE WAGES HAVE GONE UP. THEY HAD A SURGE IN HEALTH CARE. THOSE WAGES HAVE GONE UP. DAVID, THERE'S A PREMIUM TO OIL, AND WE KNOW THERE'S A WAR PREMIUM TO OIL, AND THAT SHOULD BE THE LEAST OF OUR CONCERNS. AS LONG AS THERE'S A WAR, THERE'S GOING TO BE A PREMIUM. IF YOU THINK THAT WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS GOING TO LAST FOR A LONG TIME, THERE'S GOING TO REMAIN A PREMIUM. THE ONLY NUMBER THAT I REALLY -- THE NUMBERS THAT I REALLY FREAK OUT ABOUT, I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED TO FREAK OUT ABOUT, ARE JUST THE ENDLESS WAYS TO FIND PEOPLE TO HAVE SOMEWHERE TO LIVE. THAT INCLUDES IMMIGRANTS, OF WHICH, BY THE WAY, SINCE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE ANY NUMBERS AT ALL, WE HAVE TO PRESUME IS HOT. IT WON'T STAY -- BY THE WAY, RAISING MORTGAGE RATES ONLY MAKES IT -- EXASPERATES. >> EXACERBATES. >> YOU DON'T WANT TO BUILD. IF YOU'RE TOL BROL BROTHERS, YO SAY, I'M GOING TO MAKE FEWER HOMES. THAT'S THE PART THAT WOULDN'T MAKE THINGS BETTER IF YOU RAISED RATES. THAT'S WHERE THE FED IS REALLY IN A BOX. FINALLY, FOOD STOPPED BEING MORE EXPENSIVE AT HOME -- IT'S A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE AT THE STORE. I LIKE THAT. BUT THESE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBERS OF AN ECONOMY THAT IS ON THE MOVE, THAT IS TERRIFIC, AND IF WE'RE ALL GOING TO SWEAT THE PROGRAM, DECIDE THAT THE TEN-YEAR AND 30-YEAR AUCTION'S GOING TO GO BAD AND GET TO 5%, YOU AND I HAVE BEEN THERE AT 5%. THAT'S CALLED A GREAT LEVEL, SO I DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF HOW UNNATURAL -- >> BUT THE FACT THAT WE MAY VERY WELL GET NO RATE CUTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS YEAR IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT PEOPLE HAD ANTICIPATED AS 2023 CAME TO AN END, NOT TO MENTION EVEN A FEW WEEKS AGO OR MONTHS AGO. >> WELL, THOSE PEOPLE -- >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE BROADER MARKET? >> THOSE PEOPLE ARE WRONG. >> THEY CAN ALSO VOTE WITH THEIR FEET AND SAY, I'M NOT GOING TO BUY EQUITIES. >> THEY CAN GO BUY CDs. THEY CAN BUY THE SHORT RATE. I HAVE A LOT OF SHORT RATE PAPER, AND I'M LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING, WHAT DO I DO? BUY MORE? BUY CDs? THE CD RATES WENT DOWN YESTERDAY. IT'S KIND OF DISCONCERTING. BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THIS TRADE, AND THEY'RE FRANTICALLY GETTING OUT, AND YOU SEE THEM FIRST IN THE FUTURES, AND THEN THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SCARED AND ARE IN THE MAG SEVEN AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MAG SEVEN ARE, OTHER THAN IT'S NOT STEVE McQUEEN AND YUL BRENNER. THEN, THEY THINK DATACENTERS AREN'T GOING TO BE BUILT OUT. THAT'S WRONG. FELLOW TRAVELERS JUST SAY, THIS MARKET'S BEEN GOOD SINCE THE FED PIVOTED. OH, MY, MAYBE THE FED'S DONE. >> ALL RIGHT, SO, WHAT DOES THE YEAR LOOK LIKE FOR A STOCK MARKET IN WHICH THE FED IS, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NEUTRAL -- IN OTHER WORDS, NO RATE CUTS? >> WELL, ONE OR NONE. RICK SANTELLI'S BEEN VERY RIGHT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE AUCTIONS, I THINK, AND YESTERDAY, HE SAID THERE WAS A SHORT RATE AUCTION THAT WAS VERY BAD, AND I THINK THIS AUCTION IS GOING TO BE VERY BAD TODAY. BUT I ALSO THINK -- I COME BACK TO SAY, LET IT COME IN. IF YOU HAVEN'TTAKEN ANY PROFITS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU OWN -- LET'S GET TO NVIDIA. I'M STICKING BY IT. I HAVE A LONG-TERM VIEW OF NVIDIA, I HAVE HAD SINCE 2012. AM I CHANGED? NO. THE INTEL SO-CALLED CLAIM THAT THEY'RE FASTER, STRONGER, THIS OR THAT, GIVE ME A BREAK. NO ONE'S COMMITTING TO THAT. NVIDIA'S A GREAT COMPANY. IT'S GOT A VERY LOW MULTIPLE, BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT NVIDIA IS, DAVID, AND YOU BOUGHT IT BECAUSE YOU LIKED WHAT I SAID ABOUT IT, JUST SELL SOME. JUST, LIKE, PLEASE SELL SOME SO I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR WHEN IT'S AT $800, WHY DIDN'T I GET THAT. >> WE DO HAVE MORGAN STANLEY RAISING ITS PRICE TARGET AS THIS CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN FOR NVIDIA. >> THEY HAVE, BUT SO WHAT? >> THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE HYPERSCALERS, PLANNING OUT DATA EXPANSION CENTERS THAT WOULD TEND TO INDICATE DURABILITY. >> THERE IS GREAT DURABILITY. OWN IT, DON'T TRADE IT. WE ALSO KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY OWN, AND WHEN YOU MEET PEOPLE WHO STOP YOU AND SAY, THANK YOU FOR NVIDIA, AND YOU FOLLOW UP AND SAY, WHAT DOES NVIDIA DO? THEY'RE STUNNED. THEY'RE STUNNED. THEY DON'T KNOW. THEY THINK, WELL, NVIDIA, LET ME TELL YOU, THEY -- THEY -- WOW. JENSEN. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- THEY'RE THE FELLOW TROAVELERS THAT I'M MOST WORRIED ABOUT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH NVIDIA. THEY SEE IT GO DOWN AND SAY, IT MUST BE WRONG. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM REASSESS, JUST LIKE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE REASSESSING THE FED. AND THEN, ONCE RATES GET TO WHERE THEY HAVE TO GO, WHICH IS NOT THAT HIGH, BECAUSE THERE IS, FRANKLY, AT A CERTAIN LEVEL, SELF-CORRECTION, YOU'RE FINE. BUT NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE FINE. WE HAVE CASH FOR THE TRAVEL TRUST. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A DECLINE. WE'RE GETTING A DECLINE. DOES THAT MEAN I SHOULD NOW WAIT FOR A BIGGER DECLINE? NO. >> I DON'T KNOW WHERE -- AS WE'RE CALLING IT A CORRECTION. THIS DECLINE OF 12% FROM THE HIGHS. NVIDIA'S MULTIPLE IS DOWN TO WHAT, JIM? WHERE ARE WE? >> IT COULD BE 23. >> YEAH. >> BUT DAVID, IF WE GO -- IF WE BORE PEOPLE AND DON'T TALK ABOUT MUSK -- HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT BUFFETT LATELY. IF WE GO OVER THIS NEWS RELEASE FROM THE -- >> ON THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, YEAH. >> THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. IT'S ENERGY. IT'S RENT. IT'S -- IT'S AUTO INSURANCE. CAN WE HAVE SOME COMPETITION IN AUTO INSURANCE? >> FOOD AWAY FROM HOME KEEPS GOING UP. >> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? STAY HOME. THE LAST MONTH WAS ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD IN TERMS OF FOOD AWAY FROM HOME. AND LIQUOR PRICES ARE COMING DOWN. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT. THESE ARE JUST STICKY. YOU NEED COMMODITIES TO COME IN A LITTLE. THEY ARE. AND YOU NEED LABOR TO COST LESS, AND THAT'S WHAT THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE IS. THE HIDDEN LABOR WORKERS IN THE KITCHEN WILL MAKE IT SO EVENTUALLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET A CHEAP BURGER OR FRIES AND NOT DIET COKE BUT JACK AND DIET. >> ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU'RE NOT OVERLY CONCERNED AS WE LOOK AT A MARKET -- WE WATCH THE S&P HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE, AGAIN, WHEN WE START TRADING 22 MINUTES FROM NOW. >> AGAIN, IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU OWN AND YOU LOOK AT THE NEWS RELEASE FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS, AND YOU DECIDE, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO BAIL OUT OF NVIDIA, BECAUSE I SEE THIS FOOD AWAY FROM HOME NUMBER IS BAD, AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT USED CARS AND TRUCKS, WELL, I MEAN -- USED CARS AND TRUCKS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD, SO FORGET THAT. BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN. YOU GOT A CHANCE. YOU'RE UP A LOT. SELL IT TO ME. COME DOWN SO I CAN BUY IT. I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I KNOW WHAT NVIDIA DOES. I KNOW THAT BLACKWELL IS MULTIPLE TIMES BETTER THAN WHAT INTEL IS DOING. I KNOW THAT GOOGLE AND NVIDIA ARE WORKING TOGETHER. I KNOW THAT JENSEN HUANG SAID IF GOOGLE'S MAKING A CHIP, I WANT TO HELP. IS THAT A REASON TO BAIL? WELL, GO AHEAD. I SAID IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AFTER THE
