MIND FOR TOMORROW AND FRIDAY AND AS WE HEAD TOWARDS THE WEEKEND, OUR NEXT REAL CHANCE OF RAIN AND SOME DECIDEDLY COOLER TEMPERATURES. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT COMING UP AT 9 30. ALRIGHT THANKS HIM WHAT'S BEING TOUTED AS A CANCER KILLING PILL, AND IT HAS SCIENTISTS EXCITED THAT THEY MAY HAVE FOUND THE HOLY GRAIL WHEN IT COMES TO CANCER RESEARCH SCIENCE COURTNEY GODFREY JOINING US NOW LIVE FROM OUR NEWSROOM WITH MORE ON THIS, COURTNEY, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW THIS TREATMENT WORKS? WELL, RANDI RESEARCHERS AT THE HOSPITAL THAT DEVELOPED THIS TREATMENT COMPARED TO A SNOWSTORM THAT CLOSES A KEY AIRLINE HUB, SHUTTING DOWN ALL FLIGHTS IN AND OUT ONLY IN THIS CASE, THE PLANES WOULD BE CARING CANCER CELLS. I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE THREE OR 45 TIMES A YEAR IS I'M GETTING MATCHED AND I KNOW OUR DEMAND IS UP ABOUT 30% IN THE PAST YEAR AS A MENTOR TO PATIENTS NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. MARY JO NYE KNOWS THE FAR REACHING IMPACTS OF THE DISEASE, WHICH IS WHY NEWS OF A BREAKTHROUGH CANCER KILLING PILL PEAKS. HER INTEREST. IT COULD BE A GAME CHANGER FOR PEOPLE AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED HERSELF. THREE YEARS AGO, I UNDERWENT A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY THIS PILL, GIVING SOME HOPE THAT FUTURE PATIENTS MAY NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO MAYBE I COULD HAVE JUST TAKEN THAT AND I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO HAVE A DUBLIN STICK TO ME. BUT THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT MINNESOTA ONCOLOGY, DR TIM LARSON, URGES CAUTION. CAUTION PEOPLE TO, UM UM RUSHED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE FOUND THE CURE FOR CANCER TREATMENT WAS DEVELOPED BY CITY OF HOPE IN CALIFORNIA AND USES A MOLECULE TO TARGET A PROTEIN CRITICAL TO THE REPLICATION OF CANCER CELLS . PRE CLINICAL RESEARCH SHOWED IT EFFECTIVE IN KILLING TUMORS ASSOCIATED WITH BREAST, PROSTATE SKIN, LUNG AND OTHER COMMON CANCERS. BUT DR LARSON POINTS OUT SO FAR IT'S ONLY BEEN TESTED ON ANIMALS. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THINGS LOOK GOOD IN THE LAB. WE'VE CURED A LOT OF MICE OF CANCER. BUT SOME OF THE SAME SO CALLED CURES WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR TESTING IN HUMANS DIDN'T ALWAYS, UM, RESULT IN THE SAME SUCCESS. STILL A SIGN OF PROMISE FOR THOSE HOPING FOR A CURE. I THINK IT'S ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLKIT IF YOU WILL FOR DOCTORS
