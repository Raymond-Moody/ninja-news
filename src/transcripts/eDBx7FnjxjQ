as we try and make some sense of some of the revisions that we got as well as this hot headline print uh Brian I want to go to you first you know as we think about th this kind of Market reaction that we're also seeing here too what do you think investors are trying to get ahead of it's not a bad report I mean we continue to se strength in the jobs data which is good and we didn't see wages climb um on a year-over-year basis I mean they they climbed 4.1% but the rate of change was was good and so you know it's a it's a pretty Goldilocks report and I think everyone's been so focused on how many rate Cuts we're going to get remember rate Cuts would have been aligned with some softness or some weakness in the economy I I would prefer a strong economic backdrop in a Fed that goes about this slowly so I view this is all favorable news here what do you think Dana do you agree well I'm certainly concerned about wages I mean wages are still uh well above the average we saw before the pre pandemic uh before the pandemic uh before that it was roughly just under 3% now we're still at 4% and so that's going to place upward pressure on overall consumer inflation the good news is that housing inflation is slowing but we're still getting that resistance from wages and certainly when we look at the payrolls yes you did have the usual suspects like government Leisure and Hospitality non-res construction and also healthc care driving a lot of the gains but we saw some broad bring to other sectors so the FED is going to be watching this to see if the labor market gets hotter and certainly causes them to pause or at least uh wait until they need to see more uh Improvement in inflation before they start cutting rates Dan when you see wage numbers like this like you were just suggesting there still remain uh pretty hot overall when you compare to those pre-pandemic levels what does that tell us then about the fight to tame inflation and the impact that this is ultimately going to have inflation in the short term well we have to ask ourselves why are wages still elevated and a lot of that is because you have Labor shortage in some of these key Industries especially if you have to physically show up to work that's probably not going to be solved overnight and so the FED is really going to have to resist this and hope that we don't see uh a Redux in goods and and energy price inflation which could be a risk certainly given the fact that we're seeing shortages in energy and we're having disease and such affecting food prices so the fed's got a t a few months ahead of them in terms of feeling confident about beginning interest rate Cuts I I guess Brian is the wage front so extreme or so significant that it would throw off some of the expense profiles of companies that we track on a day and day up basis and try to see how that might impact their margins as well and the trade that a lot of investors have to think about too no I don't think so I mean remember companies are generating profits nominally and so we're we're still in a good nominal growth grow backdrop and again strong a strong economy will be good for for business yeah we may see you know expenses up a bit but we're also seeing very good um revenue reports and if you um you know these these businesses have done a a reasonably good job of getting back the workers we have to remember why this all happened this all happened because businesses cut workers and slashed inventory at the worst time for years years ago and so we're still coming through that they're bringing back workers the inventory levels are better I don't think we're moving back into a period where we're at Price instability wages are up corporate profit corporate earnings are hit by that I I don't think that's what this is what we're talking about to me this is a a good backdrop of of strong growth and and prices that may be a little bit elevated but I wouldn't call it price inst stability Dana what do you think this is going to do for the feds timeline of cutting rides does it push off that First Rate cut and does it also make it a bit more likely that maybe we could only see two cuts before the end of the year well I think it's too early to tell uh before the May meeting we'll get a few more inflation prints from the CPI the pce deflator and certainly um in June which is where we think when we think the FED might start cutting interest rates we're going to get even more inflation print so um I think it's too early to say that the FED is not going to go the 75 bases points that the SCP suggests but we do need to watch these data uh very closely over the next few months I was I was really interested Dana in the the consumer confidence print that came out just last week and I was reading through some of your commentary on it as well and and recession fears continued to Trend downward both in W in responses you mentioned as well as um by consumers perceived likelihood of a US recession over the next 12 months is there anything within these reports that we've seen most recent if we're straming together different pieces of economic data that signals to you that hey maybe a recession is not coming or if it's so far out that the FED has a lot of room to just sit on its hands for a while well we think consumers are right there probably is not going to be a recession but we do think that us growth is going to slow around the middle of the Year mainly because consumers probably are tapped out um they're not seeing the big wage gains in fact some people who quit are seeing their wage gains slow pretty material and also uh those excess savings from the stimulus checks are probably gone and consumers have racked up a lot of credit card debt and the interest they're paying is very high so we think consumers are probably going to rethink their budgets maybe pull back a little bit on spending and certainly not buy any homes and so that's going to help slow the economy over the course of this year and that actually would provide the FED with a little bit more room to go ahead and cut interest rates even if inflation is still a little bit sticky BR when you take a look at the Market's reaction that we've seen over the last couple of minutes obviously we're still sorting things out here ahead of the opening bell but we initially saw a dip now we're back pushing higher here for futures does that reaction here the that gain that we're seeing pre-market does that make sense to you well we'll see how the day plays out I think the initial reaction to the jobs report was aligned with the fed you know what we're not going to be able to get these rate cuts um but you know a market that's up on a strong jobs day in an environment where prices again are relatively stable that the cost of living may be a little bit too high and and maybe the the rate of change is slightly above what the FED wants we could debate that but it's not a period of price instability and so yeah I think the markets should be pleased with a better nominal growth backdrop an environment in which the jobs numbers are are still strong I mean that's that's obviously supportive for spending which is a large percentage of this economy Brian just lastly while we have both of you here if there is one trade that Traders investors should perhaps initiate off of a report like this or think about for their portfolio this morning you know off of reading this report what what would that be well it might seem a little paradoxical but I still think investors should be looking a lock in yields and the reason I say it's paradoxical is because this high for longer means people would say I want to sit in money markets and and get what I can get but this environment's not going to be here forever things will moderate at some point rates will will come back down at some point so I look at this as any time yields jump whether it's treasuries municipal bonds high quality corporate bonds take advantage of it and and lock in those yields this is an opportunity that's presenting itself to investors that may not be back for a while
