our Second Story is about cars specifically electric vehicles EVS if you're looking to buy an EV you are in luck because right now this is a buyer's market the prices are going down and the number of companies offering electric cars is going up in countries like China there is in fact an over Supply and a new player has zoomed into the arena looking to shake up the industry and park itself in Pole Position we're talking about xiaomi a household name in smartphones and electronics xiaomi is now entering the electric car market last week they launched their first Eevee a sedan called the speed Ultra 7 or su7 for short speed Ultra 7 this car has made a rocking debut within 24 hours of launch xiaomi had more than 88,000 orders and now there's a long wait list many of those who booked a car will have to wait for at least six months to get it it's a dream launch xiaomi's new car is a super hit even before it rolls out of showrooms the company's stock price has has surged by 16% their market value has jumped by more than $7 billion xiaomi's valuation in fact touched $55 billion today which makes it more valuable than car companies like General Motors and Ford General General Motors is worth $52 billion Ford is worth 53 billion and xiaomi at 55 billion is bigger than them the electric car has supercharged xiaomi as of now the su7 is available only in China but this launch is generating Global buzz and the reason for that is xiaomi's business strategy it's aggressive pricing the base model is priced at around $29,000 that's close to 25 lakh rupees now compare this to a Tesla a xiaomi car is at least $4,000 cheaper than a Tesla and at this price point xiaomi is not making a profit in fact it is losing money on every car sold it will lose $10,000 $10,000 per car so this price war with Tesla will bleed xiaomi let me show you an assessment it is by City research they say if xiaomi sells 60,000 cars this year the company is set to lose 4.1 billion yuan which is around 56 million us so at this rate the more cars they sell the more money they will lose which brings us to the question why is xiaomi doing it because it can and the Chinese state is helping it xiaomi has a cash reserve of $15 billion so it can afford the price War and the loss plus it has the backing of Beijing you see xiaomi is not building these cars on its own it is using a state-owned manufacturer a company called the B IC group they are the ones making the xiaomi Eevee China already has a large EV ecosystem xiaomi is simply leveraging it to enter a new market and to disrupt it they can sustain a short-term loss to get a foothold in the EV market and China State infrastructure is helping them do this Beijing has spent big money to build it this infrastructure from 2019 to 2023 Beijing handed out $28 billion 28 billion this was in the form of subsidies and tax breaks to EV makers and these stops attracted many players they made China the world's largest ev Market in fact now it's overcrowded there are at least 200 car makers in China 200 companies they make both EVs and hybrid cars last year China cut some of these subsidies so these 200 companies are now looking to compete in New Markets outside China and the rest of the world should be on guard the US Treasury secretary has already issued warnings her name is Janet Yellen she says China is treating the global economy like a Dumping Ground they have more EVS than buyers so they're sending their cars overseas in fact let me quote from her statement I'm concerned about global spillovers from the excess capacity that we are seeing in China China's over capacity distorts Global prices and production patterns and hurts American firms and work workers as well as firms and workers around the world Europe is concerned too according to one report one out of four EV sold in Europe this year will be made in China One out of four and Chinese Eevee makers are eyeing India to including the company called byd the world's biggest seller of EVS today last month byd announced that it wants to cover 90% of India's EV Market by the end of 2024 this year 90% of the market market so the Chinese are coming for everyone and it's no longer about who sells the best car it's about who can bleed the other side more it's not a Level Playing Field Chinese companies have state subsidies they artificially lower prices and kill competition so governments around the world need to step in and protect their markets and their companies against Chinese dumping for
