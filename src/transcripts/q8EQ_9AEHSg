hey what's up Good People welcome back to stock up with Larry Jones hey we're going to get into the jobs numbers it could really move the market I am starting to record this for those of you that are watching it later uh I am starting this in the pre-markets as you could see um the pre-markets the Dow is up 100 the S&P and the NASDAQ they are all positive after a selloff uh on Thursday okay so let's get right into the job numbers and um uh before you do that make sure you hit the like subscribe and notification Bell I know I'm looking like this please forgive me I am headed to the barber shop and you don't want to see this ha this morning all right let's get into these job numbers these are the numbers that we're looking for okay let's take a look let's take a listen a hotter print could potentially cause the FED to push off at first Ray cut still the market very optimistic that we could see that first R cut come in June but if we do get a hotter than expected print on wages that of course could cause the FED to delay just a bit what we are expecting to see on that month over month basis is a climb of 3/10 of a percent so that would certainly be an uptick from what we saw last month where we just where we got a rise of just about a tenth of a percent so wage growth is still running hot we haven't seen much uh really relief there or as much as the FED probably would like to see at this point and again ahead of this print BR you have Futures looks like on track to open the day higher although all of that could change in just about 15 seconds yeah it's been interesting here especially with some of the FED speak that we've gotten over the course of this week the Market's lingering on every word of some of these fed presidents who have come out and signaled where their inclination will be to lend their voice into this debate into this conversation for the policy decision in the next meeting as well here and as we get uh the jobs print wow another hot number here for the 303,000 jobs added to the US economy again the expectation was for 214,000 so a beat by a another wide margin we're seeing that reaction right away in the Futures Market coming off the highs there just a bit and now we're actually moving back to the upside here but again that headline number 303,000 unemployment rate uh ticking down a tenth of a percent from the prior reading at 3.8% that was in line with the Street's expectations wages hourly wages on a month- over month basis is coming in in line with expectations a gain of 3/10 of a percent the year-over-year change or growth I should say is 4.1% that's a bit lower uh bit softer growth than what we saw last month of 4.3% and again when you take a look as some of the revisions here which we know are so critical at this time it looks like last month uh the jobs gain that we got was revised slightly lower 270,000 there the initial rating was 275,000 last month but again the headline number this month once again is showing the fact that the market the labor market remains extremely resilient and too strong I think many people would say for the fed's liking at this point yeah I'm looking through some of the additional data where the job gains occurred most healthare government construction some of those sectors we're going to be breaking down as well with our team of reporters our Newsroom all across this right now buzzing it's in a stir at this point in time and one of the people standing by in that Newsroom we've got Jared blicker as well here finan Zone standing by at the Wi-Fi inter so we could see a little hotter hotter than expected um let's see what's going on the job the job report actually the jobs are showing that they are resilient okay and let's see what the FED is thinking now all right um I believe there'll probably be more like uh two um interest rate Cuts rather than three you know uh few later okay but you know I don't think this is uh a a really I don't think the market will have an over knee-jerk reaction as we can see right now we're still in the pre-markets good people as you can see now the Dow is uh uh positive 93 so mostly unchanged as you could see mostly unchanged remember it's Friday and on Fridays the market tend to uh do this yo-yo reaction even though we are positive now in the pre-markets as you could see the Dow 94 S&P as we can see that this is green it could be red by closing bell so be careful uh on your long positions okay so be very careful as we could see look at that jumped right back up down 100 S&P 18 uh points and a NASDAQ 72 points so let's see remember the first two hours of the market is usually the most volatile that's every day okay uh followed by the last half hour uh uh of the market so be careful midday today is what I'm going to say uh to you guys so here's why the stock market uh sold off on Thursday if you can read here um all three major averages reversed strongly midday against I'm sorry again after Minnesota fed president Neil you know suggested that the FED may not cut this is what sold the market off may not cut interest rates this year if inflation progresses or stalls okay or progress stalls so here's why the stock market sold off on Thursday okay I know that there uh was a lot of reports one was uh you know about cyber security uh there is a threat even within the next 48 hours uh an attack on a country I don't even want to say it now because I don't want this to be turn political and so that's the fears that's going on in uh the market and so we're on heighten alert but this was the true story if you see when he spoke what actually happened that's what sold the market off on Thursday let's take a look at some cyber security plays okay so we have Pala Alto which we know is one of you know Nancy Pelosi plays uh she's she has a far out option on uh this stock I want you to look at this stock yourself it's very expensive um um to buy it's not that expensive compare in compared to a bigger stock but keep an eye out on cyber security stock um let's so this is one I want you to keep your eye on P NW um if you do buy I would say Buy on red days okay and another one that I am accumulating just the stock no options is paler uh pltr um I've been accumulating paler and um just been buying chunks of it I don't have any option plays on it at this time but that may change but I have just been buying plenty of paler when I I kind of dollar cost average on it but when it is beat down really bad on red days I buy bigger blocks of it okay so not spending all of the House's money just buying it e even though this stock is 2248 at this time I believe that this could be a $100 stock I believe that this stock could 4X as soon as the end of 2025 into q1 of 2026 so I want you guys to put palent paler I'm sorry on your radar I know it was hot back in the day but it still has some steam okay so I don't I don't know I don't have I can't predict the future but all I could say is if and that's a big fat if if they get just the right size government contracts this stock could soar and so I'm just adding uh I've been adding for the last uh year or so and I'm just buying on red days because because of the heightened alerts of wars and rumors of wars like the Bible says um I believe I believe that cyber security is a big one and if you if that stock is not for you for any personal or moral or religious reasons you know then just don't buy it but we are going to talk about it here I'm being transparent I do own it all right all right so let me get to
