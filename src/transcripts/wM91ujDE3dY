here's why the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates and much more at its meeting next [Music] month hello I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate these turbulent times the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meets again in about three weeks and the focus will be on whether the Central Bank Cuts its base interest rate or Hold Steady the consensus is that the FED will sit still it shouldn't instead the rate should be reduced but not for the reasoning that dominates fed thinking for years the Federal Reserve and other central banks have operated on the assumption that an active economy causes inflation the Phillips curve is an economic model that posits that there's a trade-off between inflation and unemployment if you want lower inflation you must increase unemployment and vice versa experience shows the Philips curve to be non nonsense including recent times unemployment remains low yet inflation's fallen down from its peak in 2022 nonetheless the Philips curve has a vice likee grip on Central Bank thinking that's why many commentators believe the FED won't move the economy is growing and there's still signs that inflation hasn't been totally beaten down thus in their way of thinking any reduction would be premature and run the risk of rekindling inflation in addition to being wrong basing policy on Philips curve thinking ends up depressing private investment thereby hurting long-term growth short-term interest rates today are too high they're above longer term yields a sure sign of a credit Market Distortion they are hurting businesses especially smaller ones to access Credit by contrast big companies have no problem selling bonds or getting short-term cash from Banks are pedaling commercial paper also hurting small Enterprises are fed regulations concerning Banks setting aside reserves for different kinds of loans this currently damages availability of credit for non-big Enterprises that is a key reason why the bank category called commercial industrial loans which go principally to non-large entities showed a shocking decline last year economic growth is fueled Now by consumer and government spending an unhealthy mix putting on even more Capital requirements as the FED may do will dampen Bank lending the FED must grasp the truth that inflation is caused by reducing the value of the dollar not people buying and selling with each other Rising prices are a symptom of inflation not its cause so the FED should cut rates and announce that henceforth its focus will be on a stable dollar at the at the same time fed head Jerome palid announced that the central bank will work faster to reduce the size of its bloated portfolio of bonds as well as continuing its wind down of reverse repurchase agreements whereby the Fed was borrowing Mammoth amounts from money market funds and financial institutions declaring that dollar stability will be the fed's focus will create a very helpful environment for commercial Investments the harmful focus on manipul ating interest rates would be over and the economy would benefit enormously I'm Steve Forbes thanks for listening do send in your comments and suggestions I look forward to being with you soon again
