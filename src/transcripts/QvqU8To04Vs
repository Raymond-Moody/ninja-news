Let's just start where we left off on
supply chains. Are you noticing any impact currently in
the U.S. when it comes to bringing in vehicles
because of the Baltimore bridge collapse?
Yeah, at the moment, our production team has been closely
working with the Port of Baltimore and of course, our new entity to find out
port points nearby for inbound vessels. And also we are working for alternative
ports. We have in the East Coast Jacksonville
temporarily to minimize the delay of delivery to the customer.
So that is a current outlook and we're looking for it.
To come back to Port of Baltimore was the operation is back on track.
So that's dealing with the finished product, the delivery of those products.
As far as making your cars here. Are you dealing with any supply chain
constraints to getting supplies and things?
We do have a separate chain issue globally.
That is a few reasons behind it. One is the best.
There are shortages during pandemic.
A compressor, a company is a scrap to all the best sellers and they are near
reinvent to more LNG based, you know, better fuel
efficiency and low CO2 vessels. That is one reason.
And the second reason is just mentioned Suez Canal and the Panama Canal is able
to pass through. And third reason is a significant
increase in exports from Italian, the mainland.
Now, those are contributing to a significant challenge for, you know,
logistics right now. I am curious.
I'm glad you brought up China. Most of what they're exporting, though,
are they those are primarily EVs or are they direct competitors to the models
that Mazda is producing? It is a combination between the pure but
the reality and the range extender and internal combustion engine.
It depends on the blend of the Chinese brand.
What car do you think will sell the most EVs hybrids or ices in the next, say,
five years? I believe a still internal combustion
engine has strong support from the consumers.
And secondly, I see great potential in hybrid.
That is a perfect solution for customers.
There is no anxiety for range, right either.
But getting traction like that, Well, we see that.
I'm curious about what the internal combustion engines, because we have seen
demand by consumers hold up, but the governments aren't necessarily on the
same page. You have a major initiatives in the
U.S., in Europe, even in China, to, you know, in order to reduce pollution and
carbon the carbon footprint, to get more people to buy electric vehicles or at
least alternative fuel vehicles here. Do you not anticipate that those
government efforts might push consumers into non-price vehicles
while consumer gradually will be better educated?
But at the moment, infrastructure and about the cost and implies and
affordability many, many very high hurdle for customer to purchase.
So it is going to be slow. Adoption pace would be expected and
regulation is alongside the different side.
We will have to deal with that. But we are focused on the consumer needs
and wants and lifestyle. Before we let you go.
You're here, you're in the US. Are you looking to make an investment in
the U.S. and would you wait until the
presidential elections over to make that call?
We have a couple of automotive plans, but the final decision is after
presidential election and purpose. No, we need to see.
You know, it is going to be a big change expected
based upon past experience, I said in the US.
So it's a big swing. So you don't feel comfortable making
that investment until you have that visibility?
We do. We do have a plan for the investment in
the future. But how and timing to be you know where
it.
