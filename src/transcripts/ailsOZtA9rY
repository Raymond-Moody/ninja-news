all right good evening folks it's enforcer Matt and welcome back to another short war video and today we have breaking news coming out of Ukraine that the Ukrainian armed forces have begun using a new type of long range jet powered UAV to attack inside the territory of belgrad which has the Russian forces in a bit of a panic as to how to respond to this new weapon we're also learning that a drone has exploded on the territory of the zapia nuclear power plant as well and that is causing a pretty big panic in that front so with that let's go ahead and take a look at our first artic of the day which goes to covert Shores on Twitter and this one says a notable Ukrainian drone strike is ongoing in belgrad Russia using jet power drones like cheap cruise missiles and the main candidates are a Ukrainian jet drone or a British built bans sheep and in this photo up top here we can see allegedly the Ukrainian built version of this drone right here it's all blacked out and this is the Drone that is allegedly being used to attack inside of belgrad or the second option is it could be a British built banshe which is depicted right here this is another possibility as well but nobody's really sure which one it actually is at the moment and we actually have a breakdown right here of the actual build of the Drone and in this photo we can see that at the front of the Drone it allegedly has a 20 kg blast fragmentation Warhead it has a large fuel tank in the center and a JetCat P400 Pro micro turbo jet in the back and we can see it's also made of fiberglass and wooden frames the cost of building this are going to be much lower than buying a cruise muscle which will give Ukraine an advantage because they can launch a whole lot more of these than they could launch cruise missiles and keep up the frequency of attacks on the Russian Mainland which is crucial to disrupting Russia and getting an edge in the war so with that we're moving on to our next article here which goes to null reports on Twitter and we can see footage of the jet power drones somewhere in the B harod region so let's take a look at this footage and see what we have and you can see the Drone going across the screen right there and it does have that distinct jet sound to it and I'll be honest with you it sounds like an RC jet basically like those hobbyist jets that you that you hear some people flying and those things are pretty fast that thing is moving at quite some speed and it also has pretty good range on it as well so it can go a pretty far distance uh which is a pretty big uh feed of Technology but with that we're moving into our next post here which goes to the Institute of the study of war and we're getting an idea of why these drones might be being used at this time it says here zalinski stated during an interview aired on April 6th that the Ukrainian forces currently do not have enough ammunition to initiate and sustain future counteroffensive operations and reiterated that Ukrainian forces are currently using drones to partially compensate for artillery ammunition shortages across the theater so they're going to start relying much more heavily on these drones to basically compensate for that so that's why I think we're seeing these jet power drones suddenly appear today because I think they're using that to compensate for the lack of ammunition uh but with that we're moving on to to our next post here which goes to Nexa on Twitter and we can see that a drone has exploded on the territory of the zapa nuclear power plant according to the iaea and we can see in a statement from the officials it says the zapa nuclear power plant informed iaea experts that a drone detonated on the territory of the plant today and such a detonation was observed by us as well and I call for refraining from actions that contradict the ia's five principles and violate nuclear safety said Grossi who's the agency's director but the iaea did not specify who launched the UAV I think we have a strong suspicion of who actually did this but it seems like the uh agency's director doesn't want to get into it um but certainly a drone impacting near the power plant is quite a big deal and you know it would seem like forces would avoid firing around this plant unless their objective is to actually cause a nuclear accident then it might make sense but otherwise that's pretty risky to be firing around this plant considering that if it has a meltdown or has some type of malfunction due to that impact that could be quite devastating for the entire European region and with that we're moving into our next article here and this one goes to Nexa and we're learning another oil refinery in Russia has halted operations and the management of the Ork neft plant has declared the suspension of activities at the local oil refinery due to the flooding in the area so in this next post here we actually have a video of the flooding from the orsk region uh and it's quite severe and this is why the oil refinery actually shut down is because this flooding is getting so bad they simply can't keep operating so let's take a look at the video and see how bad this flooding actually is and you see the people are using boats to get around that's apparently the only way you can actually get around this area at the moment is by some more watercraft and basically everyone is doing that and you can see the water is basically up the doorways here um in fact it's actually cover part of the doorways uh and this water is only getting worse by today and we're also told here in addition the work of the plant is impossible because the way tracks in orsk were flooded so another oil refinery taken down out of action this time not by Ukraine but actually from their Dam imploding and actually breaching it seems like the Russian oil industry is really having some severe problems all the way around but with that we're jumping into our next article here which also goes to Nexa and we're learning Ukrainian border guards have repelled another Russian assault in the bakut area and an enemy armored group of 23 Russians supported by a tank and four armored personnel carriers a attempted to storm the positions of the Ukrainian Defense Forces however the occupiers were defeated and then they retreated so that is a success in the bakut area and even though Ukraine is having a slight shortage of ammunition at the moment they're still succeeding in repelling the Russian assaults even though the Russians are throwing every person they've got at the meat grinder trying to get their way through basically with human waves so it's not working for the Russians and the ukrainians are still having a pretty big success but with that we're jumping into our next article here which goes to Ian Ellison on Twitter and we're going to switch gears just a little bit and cover the Iran Israel situation because that is still Brewing up in the background here we can learn that a Iranian spy ship and forward base MV bashad has been running dark on AIS for 48 hours and AIS is the tracking of the ship and it's been dark it's been off the radar and Bashan has also disappeared in early February prior to retaliatory us strikes and soon after was the target of a US Cyber attack and as we can see here the bash's departure from its normal areas of operation is significant again and in the past Iran has taken the bashad off station to mitigate the risk of us and Israeli retaliation uh in response to past Iranian strike this is a pretty big deal as well the ship is going dark to basically hide itself from attack and that is a sign of things to come in the future and it's also a sign that Iran is still planning something in the background and US intelligence and Israeli intelligence believes it'll happen before the Ramadan day so moving on to our next article here we actually have one from global Military info and once again this is a warning of things to come us officials have told CBS that Iran is actively preparing a swarm of drones and cruise missiles for the upcoming Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel and the strike is expected to be timed around the end of Ramadan like I said before predicted to end on April 9th today is April 7th so this is just right around the corner when us officials actually expect Iran to perform this major escalation and obviously the US forces are on high alert preparing for this and Israeli forces are as well we've seen a lot of equipment being moved around in preparation for it and it seems like this is an imminent thing that's about to happen and not a question of if but more like when but that is all the news we have on that at the moment and that is actually our last piece of news for the day and I
