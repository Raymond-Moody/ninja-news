the electric car price premium has evaporated it's gone I've been saying this would happen for a long time now and I know that many of you knew this would happen as well currently there is actually no price premium buying an EV versus a gasoline or petrol diesel powered car in the United States it's actually cheaper in many cases if you qualify for Ev incentives it actually is cheaper now there are currently 57 electric vehicle mod models for sale in the US while Tesla of course is still the most popular they have around 55% market share new players in the market are driving competition and prices continue to drop so Tesla does have competition and therefore they are pushing prices down in order to keep their market share and they keep on selling more EVS EV sales are still growing but because the growth hasn't been as fast as what it was in the past few years which it never could be EV sales have grown by 360% over the past 3 years that was unsustainable therefore what that means is the enthusiastic early adopters most of them have already bought in they might be up for a second car but they might not the market hasn't been successful in general at getting the hardcore gasoline car fans to convert to an EV without you know a better infrastructure and with relatively mediocre consumer education in the United States EV sales are lagging behind projections this year so far far this is driving prices down according to data from Cox Automotive the price premium for an EV over a gasoline vehicle is now less than $5,000 that's down from a $117,000 price Gap in 2022 so the the price premium is actually around $4,000 right now but if you include EV incentives most people qualify for them most people don't make more than $200,000 a year so most people a qualify that means there is no price premium in fact for some models a VV it's cheaper when you compare that vehicle to an equivalent gasoline or petrol diesel powered vehicle of course there's other savings as well I mean in an electric car you don't have to use your brakes you don't have to replace rotors and brake pads you can just use regen braking uh there's other big advantages in terms of daily running costs a lot of people have solar panels they can just charge their EV using solar there's heaps of reasons why EV in general is actually going to save you immense amounts of money but we're talking the The Upfront purch cost in fact incredibly right now the cheapest vehicle to lease in the United States is an EV it's a Hyundai ion X6 it's $250 a month with increased competition segment leader Tesla has resorted to some pretty serious price Cuts in an attempt to maintain its market share Tesla's popular model 3 sedan fell in price from $47,000 in early 2023 to only 39,000 today a model white performance fail from $70,000 to 52,000 today but the most expensive vehicle that Tesla sell the Tesla Model S and the model X were they'll both reduce in price by $440,000 year-over year in some cases um we've seen even bigger price discounts from Tesla depending on the month you know they have different prices month to month but these precipitous price drops are driving the competition to lower their prices as well in addition to factory price Cuts dealers are doing deals on electric car inventory some of them models from 2023 and some vehicles are selling at a lot less than what you would expect I mean dealers do deals on gas powerered vehicles and EVS as well and in some cases well the average prices of EVS apparently dropped by $2,000 in February alone compared to January we're going to continue to see price Cuts or discounts just because there's in ventry and dealers are trying to get these sold said Stephanie Valdes strey director of Industry insights at Cox Automotive and does that mean there's no demand it doesn't of course it doesn't mean that but keep in mind America's America's new car inventory has hit alltime records it's nearly at 2 million cars right now so there's too much inventory across the entire car market the price dropping Trend isn't going to end battery pack prices have continued to come down making it possible for manufacturers as they ramp up manufacturing and the price of making a vehicle becomes cheaper to continue to Discount Vehicles there's a number of other factors though that could influence prices in the short term if Chinese automakers figure out a way to get their less expensive EVS into the US market you'll see vehicle prices come down pretty much immediately but seeing as battery prices are now more than 92% cheaper than what they were in 2008 the truth is it's really no more expensive to make an EV versus a gasoline powered vehicle you couldn't say that a year ago but it is actually correct today now if you're General Motors and you're manufacturing expensive batteries yourself and you're not doing a very good job of it that's not going to be true but if you're Mass manufacturing batteries or if you're using batteries from catl lithium phosphate it's no more expensive to mass manufacture an EV versus a gasoline powered car but if you look at used EV prices well they've come down just as much if not more the price of used EVS is dropping like a stone as consumers prefer to buy when dealing with a new technology so there's some amazing prices on used EVS now you couldn't say that last year either but the used EV Market is a huge opportunity price is the biggest barrier to entry for most new car buyers and for new technology I mean smartphones there I remember I didn't buy an iPhone personally for the first couple of years I thought they were too expensive well after a few years they were no longer too expensive and all the features and the benefits versus the old Nokia crapola you know the old Blackberry phones with a million batteries on them I mean the smartphones were just that much better and we can say that about EVS once the prices come down to the point where there's no longer any reason to buy a gasoline powered vehicle or diesel powered vehicle then we'll see ev adoption continue to Skyrocket there's one EV right now that proves the point and that's the niss and leaf it currently cost $28,000 and does qualify for the EV incentive right It's Made in America equivalent gasoline powered vehicles might be what $25,000 pretty similar in price but they don't qualify for any incentives so you might be able to get a niss and leaf for even cheaper than a gasoline powered car now if the niss and leaf doesn't uh interest you well it tells the model y the cheapest model y cost $42,000 and with that incentive applied it's $34,500 there's really no better car that you can get in the US at that price right now in my opinion and it does prove the point here that EVs and gasoline powered vehicles have hit price parody you just didn't realize that it happened thanks for [Music] watching [Music] [Music]
