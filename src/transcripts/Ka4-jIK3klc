>>>? >>>? JOBS REPORT BROUGHT NEW NEW TODAY FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY AND THE PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC POLICIES. 303,000 NET JOBS WERE ADDED TO THE ECONOMY, PUSHING AND EMPLOYMENT DOWN SLIGHTLY TO 3.8%. WAGES ALSO CONTINUE TO RISE, THEY'RE NOW UP OVER 4% FROM WHERE THEY WERE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. THIS IS NOW THE 39th STRAIGHT MONTH OF JOB GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REMAINED UNDER 4% FOR 26 STRAIGHT MONTHS. THE MARCH JOBS REPORT FEEDBACK EXPECTATIONS BY 100,000 JOBS, ALL GOOD NEWS FOR A PRESIDENT RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION. THE FASTEST GROWING INDUSTRIES THIS MONTH, HEALTHCARE, GOVERNMENT, HOSPITALITY, AND CONSTRUCTION, HAVE CONSISTENTLY LED JOB GROWTH IN THE POST- PANDEMIC COME BACK. NUMBERS WERE SO GOOD PRESIDENT BIDEN'S HARSHEST CRITICS ON FOX WERE FORCED TO ADMIT IT. >> YOUR REACTION TO THIS JOBS REPORT? >> VERY GOOD, MARIA. THE HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYMENT WAS UP ALMOST 500,000, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL, THE WORK WEEK WAS STABLE. IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW. IT'S A GOOD NUMBER, NO QUESTION. >> A GOOD NUMBER, BUT IS IT TOO GOOD FOR RATE CUTS? >> TODAY'S GOOD JOB NUMBERS ARE DIRECT REBUKE TO THE FALSE NARRATIVE THAT FOX IS TRYING TO SELL ITS VIEWERS. MANY OF US WOULD LIKE INTEREST RATE CUTS. BUT JOBS ARE THE BEDROCK OF AN ECONOMY. THE NORMAL HUMAN RESPONSE IS TO CELEBRATE JOB CREATION, NOT TO WARN AGAINST IT. LAST NIGHT DURING ITS MOST UNHINGED PRIME TIME HOUR, THE NETWORK BROUGHT ON FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL AND CURRENT FOXBUSINESS HOST LARRY KUDLOW, FOR A SEGMENT THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY LIED ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THE BIDEN ECONOMY WHILE ALSO MANAGING TO DENIGRATE MIGRANTS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO REPLAY THOSE LIES, BUT THE VISUAL SEEKS FOR ITSELF. TODAY THE PRESIDENT RELEASED A STATEMENT THAT READ IN PART, THREE YEARS AGO I INHERITED AN ECONOMY ON THE BRINK OF A WITH TODAY'S REPORT OF 300,000 NEW JOBS IN MARCH WE HAVE PASSED THE MILESTONE OF 15 MILLION JOBS CREATED SINCE I TOOK OFFICE. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN UNDER 4% FOR THE LONGEST STRETCH IN MORE THAN 50 YEARS. WAGES ARE GOING UP. INFLATION HAS COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY BUT I WON'T STOP FIGHTING FOR HARD- WORKING FAMILIES. JOINING US NOW, ROBERT RICE, PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR THIS CONVERSATION, HE WAS THE SECRETARY OF LABOR FOR THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. I WANT A QUOTE, FROM A GOLDMAN SACHS REPORT, WHICH SAYS, THE U.S. ECONOMY DOESN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN STRONG GROWTH AND COOLER INFLATION. WE CAN HAVE BOTH. WHY? IMMIGRATION. THAT WAS HER COMMENTARY ON THE REPORT THERE IN. THIS IMMIGRATION CONVERSATION IS RELEVANT TO WHY THIS ECONOMY IS GOING THE WAY IT'S GOING. >> UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS. AND IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT ONLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY IN TERMS OF AN AGING ECONOMY PROVIDING THE JOBS THAT THE PEOPLE WE NEED FOR THESE JOBS, BUT ALSO IT GIVES US A CUSHION AGAINST WAGES PUSHING AGAINST PRICES, AND CAUSING INFLATION. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE HAD A SOFT LANDING, AND I DO THINK WE'VE HAD A SOFT LANDING, IS BECAUSE OF THE COMBINATION OF BIDEN'S INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, AND OTHER MAJOR PUBLIC GOODS, AT THE SAME TIME, WE'VE ALSO HAD A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS, AND THAT'S BEEN A GOLDEN COMBINATION FOR THIS ECONOMY. >> IT IS A VERY TOUGH THING, AS YOU KNOW, AS A FORMER LABOR SECRETARY, TO ACHIEVE. YOU CAN'T SUPER CONTROL THE ECONOMY, BUT THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE JOBS FOR PEOPLE THAT THE WAGES AND THOSE JOBS GO UP AT A RATE IS HIGHER THAN INFLATION, THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MONEY, THEY SPEND IT, CREATING BUSINESS ACTIVITY, ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WITHOUT OUT-OF-CONTROL INFLATION. THAT'S A VERY HARD SOUP TO MIX. >> IT'S VERY HARD. WE ARE ON THE WAY, I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO EAT THESE WORDS, TO REPEALING THE BUSINESS CYCLE. THE COMBINATION OF WHAT THE FED HAS DONE, IN TERMS OF RAISING INTEREST RATES IN A WAY THAT FIGHTS INFLATION, COMBINED WITH MAJOR PUBLIC INVESTMENTS THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE, AND IMMIGRATION, SEEMS TO BE THE FORMULA, AND MAYBE IT MEANS WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY AS MUCH ABOUT INFLATION OR RECESSION. >> I WANT TO PUT UP A SCREEN THAT SHOWS THE JOBS CREATED BY INDUSTRY. HEALTHCARE IS THE LARGEST ONE, THAT'S BEEN VERY TYPICAL FOR MANY YEARS, NOW, GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE, WORKERS, GOVERNMENT LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY, CONSTRUCTION, RETAIL, OTHER SERVICES. I WANT TO, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT THESE THINGS OVER THE YEARS THAT WE'VE TALKED, ASK YOU, WHAT'S THE WEAK SPOT IN THE TYPE OF JOBS BEING CREATED? WHEN WE HAVE GOOD NUMBERS WE START TO THINK ABOUT QUALITY. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE QUALITY OF JOBS BEING CREATED? >> UNTIL RECENTLY, JOBS WERE NOT GENERATING VERY MUCH WAGE GROWTH, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU CONSIDERED INFLATION. INFLATION WAS TAKING AWAY, IN WHATEVER WAGE GROWTH WE HAD. MORE RECENTLY, WE FIND THAT WAGES ARE GROWING HIGHER AND FASTER THAN INFLATION. INFLATION IS DOWN, WAGES ARE STARTING TO COME UP. THIS IS REALLY WHY CONSUMER SENTIMENT IS STARTING TO LOOK AS GOOD AS IT IS. IN THE POLITICAL CONTEXT, THE QUESTION IS, DO WE HAVE A FORMULA THAT WILL, OVER THE NEXT SEVEN MONTHS, GET ENOUGH PEOPLE THINKING THAT THE ECONOMY IS GOOD ENOUGH TO RE- ELECT JOE BIDEN? I THINK THE CHANCES ARE GOOD. >> WHAT DO YOU WORRY ABOUT IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS? I KNOW THE STOCK MARKET HAS DONE WELL TODAY, UNUSUAL FOR A STOCK MARKET TO END HIGHER ON A DAY WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT IS LAWYER, BECAUSE SOMETIMES INVESTORS THINK THAT MEANS HIGHER WAGES AND MORE INFLATION. THE FEDS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO, THEY SIGNALED THEY'RE GOING TO CUT RATES THREE TIMES THIS YEAR. MARKET ISN'T GOING TO SHOULD THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, WHAT'S YOUR SENSE? >> I HOPE THE FED DOES CUT RATES, KEEPING RATES HIGH AT A TIME LIKE THIS, WHEN PEOPLE STILL ARE CONFRONTING A HOUSING MARKET WHERE MORTGAGES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE, CAR LOANS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE, A LOT OF THE BIG PURCHASE ITEMS, BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE VERY HIGH, ARE VERY HIGH AND DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE, SO I HOPE THE FED DOES BEGIN TO RESPOND TO THE GOOD NEWS, AND ALSO THE LOWER INFLATION. I THINK THIS IS A BIG DEAL, THE FED HAS AND DESERVES CREDIT AS
