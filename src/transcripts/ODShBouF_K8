THE TRADING WEEK. THE DOW FUTURES OFF 35 POINTS. JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE IS SEEING IN THE MARKETS NOW IS TOM LEE. HE IS THE GLOBAL ADVISORS MANAGING PARTNER AND CNBC CONTRIBUTOR. TOM, WE ARE SITTING VERY NEAR ALL-TIME HIGHS. YET, IT DOES FEEL LIKE THERE IS SOME NERVOUS NNESS IN THE MARKE AT THIS POINT. A LOT OF THIS IS COMING FROM HOTTER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION NUMBERS AND STRONGER THAN EXPECTED JOBS REPORTS AND MOVING NUM MANUFACTURING ISM. THAT HAS PEOPLE WONDERING IF THE FED WILL CUT RATES. AREUNNERVED BY THIS? >> I THINK, BECKY, THIS WEDNESDAY WILL ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS. YOU SUMMED IT UP WELL. CAN THE FED BE IN THE POSITION TO REDUCE REAL RATES IF WE HAVE GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH? THIS COMING WEDNESDAY IS THE MARCH CPI. IT WILL BE THE FIRST CLEAN CPI REPORT OF THE YEAR. IT WON'T HAVE ANY RESIDUAL SE SEASONALITY. WE EXPECT IT TO BE A GOOD REPORT. LOWER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION. IT WILL HELP INVESTORS GET TO THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN HAVE GOOD GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY AND THERE IS SLACK IN THE LABOR MARKETS. INFLATION IS FALLING FAST ENOUGH TO CUT RATES THIS YEAR. >> I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE TO BUY ON THE DIP. NOT THAT THERE IS MUCH OF A DIP. DOES IT MATTER IF THE FED CUTS RATES? EARNINGS ARE STRONG ENOUGH. IS THAT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY VALUATIONS AT THIS POINT? >> I THINK THE FED BEING SUPPORTIVE OF THE ECONOMY AND MANAGING THE BUSINESS CYCLE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE FED WAS FIGHTING INFLATION AND HAWKISH. THAT WAS TOUGH FOR EQUITIES. IF WE ARE IN A MODE WHERE THE FED DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY CUTS IT NEEDS TO MAKE, BUT SUPPORTS THE BUSINESS CYCLE, THAT IS GOOD FOR STOCKS. YOU DON'T NEED THREE RATE CUTS. YOU COULD HAVE A GOOD SCENARIO WITH THE FED ONLY CUTTING ONCE. IF THE FED IS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY FEEL THE NEED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES, THAT IS BAD FOR STOCKS. >> TOM, HOLD ON JUST A MOMENT. WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS. WE WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR REACTION. IF YOU DON'T MIND LISTENING. >> WE HAVE NEWS CROSSING THIS MOMENT. JAMIE DIMON'S JPMORGAN CHASE IS PUBLISHING HIS ANNUAL LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS. WE WANT TO BRING YOU THE NEWS IN THE LETTER. HIGHLY WATCHED LETTER ANNUALLY. DIMON WRITES THE FOLLOWING. HE SAYS DESPITE THE UNSETTLING LANDSCAPE, WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND UKRAINE, GROWING GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS IN IT CHINA AND POLAR 00ED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, HE BELIEVES IT IS RESILIENT AND THE MARKET IS PRICING IN A 70% TO 80% CHANCE OF SOFT LANDING. DIMON THINKS THE USUAL YOU IS LOWER. CITING ONGOING FISCAL SPENDING AND REMILITARIZATION OF THE WORLD AND THE GLOBAL TRADE AND THE GREEN ECONOMY. ANOTHER ISSUE IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. DIMON WRITING THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY. HE SAYS JPMORGAN CHASE HAS GROWN THE A.I. ORGANIZATION MATERIALLY WITH MORE THAN 2,000 MACHINE LEARNING EXPERTS OR DATA SCIENTISTS ON THE PAYROLL. DIMON ISSUING A WARNING. WE MAY BE ENTERING THE PROPER TREACHEROUS GEOPOLITICAL ERAS SINCE WORLD WAR II. HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE LARGE DEFICIT SUPPORTED BY KWAUN TAYL KWA QUAN QUANTATIVE EASING. HE SAID THIS MAY BE CREATING RFK TO ECLIPSE ANYTHING SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE SHOULD NOT TAKE THEM LIGHTLY. >> IT IS INTERESTING. JAMIE DIMON IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN FAIRLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND THE ECONOMY. HIS CONCERN ABOUT THE GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS IS ONE ECHOED BY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE OPTIMISTIC IF YOU TALK TO WARREN BUFFETT. >> THE LETTER IS OPTIMISTIC. WE JUST HIT ON WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS THE NEWS PIECE IN THE TONALLY, HE IS TALKING ABOUT A.I. THIS IS 20 YEARS SINCE THE BANK WON THE JPMORGAN CHASE WHICH PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF THE COMPANY. THE LARGEST BANK IN THE COUNTRY, MARKET CAP WISE. IT GOES TO OTHER PIECES TO IT. IT IS A WORTHY READ. >> THERE ARE A FEW CEOs WHO ACTUALLY WRITE THEIR OWN LETTERS WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT LAWYERS AND OTHER PEOPLE GOING THROUGH IT AND READING IT AND TELLING THEM WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T SAY AND WRITING IT FOR THEM. JAMIE DIMON, OBVIOUSLY, A HUGE ONE. WARREN BUFFETT, JEFF BEZOS WROTE A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD LETTER THAT YOU COULD TELL WAS WRITTEN BY HIM WITH THEIR VOICES. LARRY FINK'S LETTER WAS UP THERE WITH THE PARENTS AT THE TOP OF THE LETTER. THAT'S WHY THESE LETTERS ARE SO INTERESTING. THE TONE IN THE MARKETS IS CONSISTENT FOR THE LAST YEAR. THAT IS THE IMPORTANT ABOUT THE SOFT LANDING NOT NECESSARILY BEING ASCERT CERTAIN AS THE MAR EXPECTATION. >> TOM HAS BEEN THE BULL. TOM, WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> UM, I THINK JAMIE IS DOING HIS SHAREHOLDERS JUSTICE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM ABOUT ALL OF THE CONCERNS OUT THERE. I THINK HE DOES A GREAT JOB OF DETAILING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG. AT THE END UP OF THE DAY, WHEN IT COMES TO MARKETS, I THINK MARKETS TEND TO PRICE CONCERNS QUICKLY. I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE CONCERN FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. THAT HARD LANDING. NOW INFLATION PRESSURE ARE EASING AT A TIME WHEN CONSUMERS DON'T HAVE A LOT OF LEVERAGE AND $6 TRILLION OF CASH ON THE SIDELINES. INFLATION, WE DON'T KNOW HOW QUICKLY IT WILL FALL. OUR BET IS IT WILL FALL QUICKLY. THAT MEANS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF HARD LANDING IS BECAUSE OF STICKY INFLATION. WE WILL HAVE A GOOD ECONOMY. >> IS THIS A TWO-PRONGED OUTLOOK ON THE ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS, TOM? IS FLAG THE ONE BIG ISSUE? IF WEDNESDAY PROVES IT IS A HOTTER THAN ANTICIPATED OR EXPECTED CPI, WOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR BOTH OF THOSE THINGS FOR THE YEAR? >> THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK IF INFLATION -- MARCH IS THE FIRST CLEAN CPI REPORT. WE KNOW THEY HAVE COME IN SOFT AND BETTER THAN EXPECTED. IF IT IS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, IT RAISES THE QUESTION THAT INFLATION IS STUBBORN AND GETTING FROM 3% TO 2% IS DIFFICULT. IF IT IS A SOFT REPORT AND FAVORED BELOW 3%, THAT IS THE CONSENSUS. THAT WILL CHANGE MINDS THAT INFLATION MAY NOT BE STUBBORN. >> YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE TO BUY. YOU HAVE BEEN BUYING ON ANY DIPS. WE'RE NOT TALKING 5% DROP, BUT 2% DROP AND YOU ARE BUYING INTO THE MARKET? >> THAT'S RIGHT. THERE ARE MANY REASONS THERE IS GAS IN THE TANK IN THE RALLY. PART OF IT IS WE THINK THE INFLATION TRAJECTORY IS ON A GLIDE PATH LOWER THAN CONSENSUS. THE SECOND IS THERE IS TOO MUCH CAUTION OUT THERE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRIME BROKERAGE BORROWING, IT IS BELOW OCTOBER OF 2021. THERE IS STILL CASH ON THE SLIDE S SIDELINE
