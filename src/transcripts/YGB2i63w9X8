on paper it certainly looks plausible in recent weeks Russia has increased the tempo of its offensive in Ukraine on the front line it's launched Battalion sized mechanized assaults one on March the 30th near tanen to the west of aifa involve 36 tanks and 12 BMP infantry fighting Vehicles Ukrainian paratroopers held off the attack destroying 20 Russian Vehicles elsewhere the Russians are pushing towards chazi Yar to the west of B mut a heavily fortified Town that's an important staging post for the ukrainians moscow's also ramped up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure exploiting ke's lack of air defense and suggesting the kremlin's trying to collapse Ukraine's power grid which would hit civilians but also the country's defense industry so is there a Russian offensive looming the Kremlin certainly trying to exploit Ukraine shortage of weapons and ammunition before any new shipments arrive Ukrainian officials claim the Russians now have a 5 to1 advantage in artillery ammunition the Russians have also reportedly been moving men and Equipment toward the front in small groups trying to make it more difficult for the ukrainians to monitor their forc buildup so I was slightly east of the city of kupiansk that's in the hark of region journalist Tom MCH embedded with Ukraine's 57th Brigade on the Eastern front he says Commanders there believe the Russians are preparing for a bigger offensive they were saying look the Russians have kept a lot of troops and armored vehicles in reserve here so they were staying effectively you know where we we think that they're getting ready for a much bigger push now the thing is that the weather in Ukraine over the last month or so hasn't hasn't been great you know the grounds are muddy but we're just getting to the season now where the grounds are firming out and hardening and that if you wanted to make any mechanized push you really could us officials say Russia has managed to reconstitute its military completely in the past few months replacing its lost troops weapons and armored vehicles if that's true Russia could quickly step up its current offensives and start new ones at other locations along the front Ukrainian commanders and president zalinsky know this so no surprise that their calls for more military aid have stepped up in a recent interview one high ranking officer said delays in Western weapon shipments are allowing the Russians to adapt and prepare for what's coming so where would any Russian push come well they could try the South reinforcing the supply line to Crimea or from the north down towards KV but the most likely scenario seems to be an intensification of what they're already doing along this Eastern Front leftenant General cillo budanov the head of Ukrainian intelligence says he expects they'll push in the dbass trying to take chazar and the town of proov northwest of adiva Tom much says the northern city of kopans which the Russians took then lost could also be a Target kopans makes the most sense for them one it's got the there's a sort of a uh there's sort of a symbolic significance to it because it was lost by the Russians rather hum in in sort of humiliating fashion back in September 2022 they would like to re I think recapture it to to recover some of the Lost Prestige from that it's also quite strategic in that it's a logistics Hub and it sort of leads the way open to the city of harv if they ever wanted to have another go at harv the only road that they can really get there from um that makes sense for them is through coupan President zinski says he expects a Russian offensive if it comes to start in late May or June so could this prove decisive well the Russians certainly have moment but Moscow hasn't carried out a full-scale mobilization and any new troops wouldn't arrive in time for a summer offensive Russia's ability to conduct mechanized Warfare also hasn't dramatically improved and it's still losing more than 900 troops a day evidence may suggest something is looming but Russian's success particularly if Congress finally unlocks America's 60 billion War chest is far from guaranteed Simon Newton forces news thanks for watching for more from fory news like And subscribe to our Channel
