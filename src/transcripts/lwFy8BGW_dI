minutes. Welcome back in a live now from Fox I'm Austin Westfall. Let's get the latest on the Russia Ukraine war for that we bring in National Security analyst and retired Marine intelligence officer. Hal camper as always how good to see you. Let's get straight into the news, Ukraine has released video of its claimed sabotage operation against a Russian warship on Sunday in the Baltic Sea Enclave of kaliningrad. Which Ukraine says, disabled The Vessel, this is yet another example how of Ukraine's success at sea. How did this sabotage operation go down. well a it's absolutely fascinating. What happened there. Uh, they they actually released and they said they kind of said they had somebody on board. uh come admitting that they had someone who was an Insider. That was actually on board that went in there. And uh and allowed them to do it and set fire to it Now. What's everyone who's I don't say everyone but many of us have looked at this saying you really kind of told too much because uh, um, that's not that tough to figure out who would have been on board who would have had access and and stuff. So I'm assuming whoever it was. they had safely speared the amount of the area so that there was no harm to them. But then again this is Putin's Russia and if they can figure that out, they know they may go after their family. uh or anyone they know in order to uh seek retribution. but this frigate which is actually a got on there they set fire to it They cost some serious damage This is kaliningrad. This is a little Enclave. That's right between Lithuania and Poland. It's a kind of a Vestige of of uh of Wars past if you will. uh, it's something that the Soviet Union took over from Germany at the end of World War II and uh, it's on the Baltic Ocean and it's fast saying because this area I'm not a few weeks ago. There was a Russian they fired a couple of missiles and they managed to hit their own ship. and caused severe damage and and by 1 report said that the ship was sinking or it was sunk. Um and that's still you know, We're still trying to figure out that it's actually the case, but that was a military exercise. They seem to be having a lot of problems now, I should mention Gir. uh, or ger the uh, the uh, Ukrainian uh military Intelligence Force. has made some rather spectacular. attacks will be Beyond. Um, Ukraine, uh out to over a fact recently out to 750 miles away from the border. these deep strike things and it's changing the nature of the war. now we I heard the word Corvette many of us probably. consider a Corvette to be a vehicle but really what we're talking about is a warship. Can you explain what a Corvette is? a Corvette and it goes back in history Corvettes are are um they're like small Sleek brigetts if you will. uh, they're not they're not big like a destroyer or something like that. Destroyer is not huge but it's a pretty good size ship. Corvettes have always been these fast moving ships, Uh, this was a missile Corvette, which is very common that you would have uh light ornaments maybe a a deck Gunner to or like guns and then a fire missiles and the whole purpose is that they can move in Shell of waters very quickly And of course the Baltic is relatively shallow Waters, so it's a sort of uh ship that you would expect surface combatant if you will. uh, that would be operational Sea where it could move in and around you know the Baltic states or in around um, the Scandinavian States like Sweden and Finland stuff like that, So that would be a a a logical ship choice for that area. Why is the Baltic Sea important in this war? Well the Baltic Sea or or as it's been nicknamed Lake. lake NATO. Um is absolutely critical Russia does not have that many outlets to the ocean. Uh, you look at Russia on the map and go well surrounded by ocean. a lot of that ocean is the Arctic which freezes in for? for a good chunk of the year. and then if you go down the coast of Vlad of Oto, even it has freezing issues, so uh year-round ports, they're rather eliminate, that's why the Black Sea, uh, where uh the Ukraine war has been so active It's such critical to them because water port. uh, the Baltic is 1 of the few areas they can get in and out. Uh, but at the end of this when the Soviet Union fell they lost most of the territory they had there which was a Baltic states Estonia. Lithuania lapia. uh that were right there. So those are now NATO countries and if you go up north, Finland, is now a NATO country Sweden is now a NATO country and of course Poland Denmark or NATO countries. uh, if you go further out, Germany, I not further out but uh but further out Norway those were all um NATO countries so basically this very small body of water which is absolutely critical for Commerce and and crucial for Russia. is now controlled by NATO countries, and it's a shallow bottle body of water. 1 of the problems that the Russians have is they have particularly submarines are rather large. and their submarines are have a difficult time maneuvering in those shallow Waters. Sweden on the other hand has submarines that are manure. uh, very well and very quietly in Shallow Waters like that. So, Sweden becoming a member of NATO is absolutely critical in the Baltic Sea. I know you're no stranger to the Baltic Sea, uh, you know this particular story comes out of the Baltic Sea. We you and I have discussed extensively about Ukraine's success in the Black Sea. um is it fair to say that Ukraine has overperformed at Sea throughout the course of this most recent iteration of the war? Well, I would say. in terms of Naval Warfare. Absolutely. Uh it is. really amazing Here's a country that that literally uh since the start of the war has had no Navy to speak of uh, they lost their ships so to speak. and what they've done is they've used drones to include unmanned surface drones even under un unmanned, uh underwater. uh Vehicles, which that's not quite clear how effective those been but the unmanned surface drones have been absolutely remarkable. These are these um, I don't know what you want to call boats. uh, but they are basically a kamakazi drone that fly that that basically drives very quickly. uh fairly early surface ship uh into a ship. uh in some cases. into a bridge like the kerch bridge that connects, uh, Russia with Crimea in the South and uh, they've been very effective and then of course unmanned drones have been very effective. Um, you know, of course taking out the uh, the flagship for the Black Sea Fleet, which was the mosebach now, Baltic of course is near and dear since I was just there. a few weeks ago, uh, very close to Clint's so uh, um, this is and and working on Maritime security matters while I was there. So this is uh, obviously something that I am, uh, rather focused on. and uh and have some rather recent visual memory. Shall we say of what that part of the world looks like, we're watching the Baltic Sea closely as always I do want to ask a little bit about the fighting on land as well though. This is video from Vladimir zalinski as he was. visiting sites that are being fortified in the northeastern city of Kiev. How how is Ukraine fairing on the battlefield right now tough time. They really do need that us Aid package. They need those armas to flow in. Uh, Europe has really stepped up in a number of ways. uh pledging more Aid, arranging more creative ways to get them made to get the Monuments, uh that deal were checked the Czech Republic basically. brokered a deal which is going to get them I think my time is done somewhere between 2.2. 25 to 2.5 million rounds of ammunition just a phenomenal amount of ammunition for their uh, uh, I'm sorry for artillery ammunition. for their 155152 and I think also for the 122 artillery pieces. that makes a big difference, but what really is needed is that 61 is dollar package? That's currently in the house. of Representatives that needs to get out there They need that. the reason you see the fortifications longer on the offense. Um, the the spring or summer offensive of last year is is over. uh, there have been Russians. at extraordinary cost in loss of of of personnel. and loss of arms. and loss of tanks and and armored vehicles and everything else. they have taken a phenomenal losses, but Russia's willing to take those losses. what Ukraine's had to do. is to move from an offensive posture into a very defensive posture and that's where you see. those trenches those fortifications You're also going to see minefields and there's a variety of other things that are really that they're working on. by the way. I might mention something numerous supports coming out. the Russians have been using chemical weapons. against destruction and that is crossing a red line. and everyone's book but that's what it looks like with the Russians are doing and and then let's expand on that a little bit. Uh, what what are the reports coming out? And what are we hearing on that front? Well what they're doing is they're trying to and basically what the reports terrify or terrorized the Ukrainian people by using. um by using these chemical weapons. some of the weapons. may be nothing more than like, uh what something akin to like pepper spray or something like that. basically, it caused panic in the line. Some of it is probably uh there have been reports of some of it type of nerve agent that they're using on the lines as well. Uh, this goes back to uh, little what we saw the Russians enabled the syrians to do. in Syria and that goes back well over a decade and that was where President Obama said. I'm going to draw red line. at uh, the use of chemical weapons. and then the US never when he did that uh, certainly that was very much remembered by Putin and so he's using chemical weapons that I'm sure his sinking is I'm probably not going to see any big anybody else to chemical weapons and and frankly so far. I haven't seen any big response to that but it is something that's in its in the news. It's been noted numerous reports and I think it's very credible. Let's uh take 1 I want to touch on 1 more thing before we take a break actually How uh, the US military said Tuesday that handed Ukraine. and array of small arms and ammunition it had seized from Iranian forces as they tried to deliver them Yemen. Take a look at the picture on your screen We're talking about a pretty large. cache of weapons here. How what's the significance of this for it's in terms of the total. of the total armaments everything helps, okay. uh 5,000, uh AK-47s, That's not a huge amount, but it could outfit a brigade or 2 with the uh with that and the sniper rifles machine guns. rocket propelled grenades. Uh, and all this would would help immensely and and that literally is the sort of uh, you know, infantry weapons that could uh outfit 1 or 2 brigades, uh, of uh of of a a, Ukrainian infantry so that helps I think the symbolism is is more significant because Iran, has been supporting Russia. all along. It's been sending them drones. uh that they've been using against the ukrainians and and other things that have been helping them out and they're kind of Uh, they're allies, uh for lack of better terms. So the significance of being able to take weapons. that Iran is using to ferment terrorism and War in the Middle East. and then send it to Ukraine where it could be used against their uh, 1 of their biggest allies, I think that that's probably has more political import. than the number of weapons or or or rounds of ammunition that we're actually sent. All right how we're going to wrap up our conversation about the Ukraine Russia War for now. But I want to take a quick commercial break and then come back and talk to you about another Ally of Russia's China that's been in the news as of late. We're going to take a commercial break. We're
