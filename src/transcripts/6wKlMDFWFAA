hi ABD I'm Meredith hyon this is industry insights thanks so much for joining me the monthly jobs report numbers provide a snapshot of the US economy they can give insight into the FED inflation and possible rate Cuts or hikes so how can investors best interpret this data joining me to discuss is zip recruiters Chief Economist Julia Pollock Julia thank you so much for joining me thank you meriff so let's Jump Right In in general how do jobs reports influence the fed well the FED has two mandates one is to keep prices stable and one is to get us to Full Employment and so they're looking for two kinds of pieces of data in the jobs report one is how strong the labor market is and the stronger the labor market the better the other is whether wage growth is under control and ideally the FED wants to see wage growth of around 3.5% year-over-year which is consistent with its 2% inflation Target and what about inflation and the possibility of rate cuts and Hikes so if you see that wage growth number coming in hotter and there isn't a sign that it's warranted by strong productivity growth well that can be a signal that the FED might hold rates higher for longer or raise them uh because those that wage growth could be inflationary and jobs reports also are a big checkin on how the economy is doing what do we see in that absolutely so we get numbers of payrolls uh added by industry we can also see how households are doing how many people are unemployed what's happening with youth employment what's happening with minorities uh there are plenty of leading indicators in this report as well like working hours and employment in temporary business services so it's really important to take a look at all of the different indicators in this report to see how much demand for work there is in this economy and whether it's likely to increase or decrease in the coming months and probably the most uh what comes to mind initially at least is what job reports tell us about job creation and information for job Seekers absolutely so anytime the unemployment rate is lower you know that it's a better environment out there for job Seekers uh that it'll be more competitive for employers because labor is scarce you know you become more valuable when you're scarce uh so that's always a good indicator to look at as well in what sectors do job reports tend to affect the most well so the jobs report tells us about job growth across 800 different Industries right and uh those have broken into some some major sectors that people follow very closely there's the goods uh producing Industries and the service providing Industries uh of course this is becoming more and more of a service economy over time and so more and more people are employed in places like retail and uh Business and Professional Services and healthc care and education uh and ever fewer are are employed in manufacturing Ing and construction uh but it it gives us a good read on what's happening in those different parts of the economy and going back we talked about the impact that jobs reports can have on inflation how does inflation though impact job creation sure so one of the major reasons that employers have been quite cautious and that hiring has slowed is that their other input costs have gone up so much that they just can't afford to hire as many people as they want so uh in inflation can weigh on businesses when inflation leads the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates that also holds job growth back because businesses and households lose access to credit and if they can't borrow well they can't go out and buy new houses or buy new factories or buy new trucks and they take a kind of wait and see approach and wait for those rates to come back down before they make those big Investments and grow and how can investors best break down these monthly reports I suggest that every investor have the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment situation PDF sort of bookmarked on their computer and they hit refresh at exactly 8:30 eastern time the first Friday of every month uh it is a really rich full report it the numbers aren't just there in tables but they're also interpreted and explained uh and it can give you very rich insight into what's happening in the economy absolutely well Julia will be watching thanks so much for joining me thank you Meredith this is industry Insight say right here on IBD for more I'm Meredith payman thanks for watching
