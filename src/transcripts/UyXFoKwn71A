our last story is about cancer it is a leading leading cause of death in the world in 20123 cancer killed nearly 10 million people that's over 26,000 deaths every single day yet we have no single cure now scientists are exploring new treatments like microts these are tiny robots they're about the same size as human cells and they're made from seaweed they can be controlled wirelessly these Bots will navigate through the cell network targ taret individual cancer cells and help prepare them so could microbots help treat cancer our next report tells you cancer a six-letter word that can scare even the bravest humans have made all sorts of advances space travel artificial intelligence but if there's something that we haven't found it's a cure for cancer cancer is the second leading cause of death globally after heart disease 10 million people people die every year from cancer yet we have no cure that's because cancer isn't just one disease it's a group of over 200 diseases cancer can start in any part of the body it happens when there are changes in a group of normal cells cancer cells have gene mutations these may be inherited or may develop over time cancer cells don't behave like normal cells our cells grow and die but cancer cells grow grow and divide out of control that leads to uncontrolled growth scientists have now found a new way to tackle these cancer cells it's microbots they are about half the width of a human hair so about the same size as cells these tiny Bots are made of seaweed millions of them can be produced in just minutes also they can be controlled wirelessly so scientists can navigate how they move and then are used to communicate with cells when we point the laser in the direction of the robot we can see that it starts to move and so we can then move it within the cell clusters and move it to other locations and then look at several cells in different ways the microbots aren't ready to help cancer patients just yet but it could in the near future the plan is very simple scientists will use these Bots to tou cell clusters they will understand how cancer cells work these microbots will then reach them and in the end help repair these cells we're we're using these micro robots to build um tissues under synthetic conditions and the whole point of this is to in the future then repair um damaged tissue or organs um at a really patient basis so if I can sort of like you know manufacturing cars in a um robotic Factory I'm sort of imagining our micro robots really picking um and placing very specific types of cells in a very specific type of um architecture so that um we can really tailor that tissue to the patients needs humans have puted billions into cancer research we have chemotherapy it's the use of toxic chemicals to kill cancer cells but it often leaves cancer patients weak for years scientists have had one question how do you treat cancer without killing normal cells these microbots could solve that problem they could Target just the cancer cells leaving the normal ones healthy at this point the research is in the nent stage but scientists believe it could be a GameChanger in the future [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] e
