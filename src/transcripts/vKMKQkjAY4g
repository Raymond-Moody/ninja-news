THIS YEAR, FOLLOWING THE STRONGER THAN EXPECTED JOBS REPORT. LET'S BRING IN DIANA SWAN. WAS IT THIS MORNING'S JOB REPORT, OR HAS THIS BEEN TRICKLING THROUGH YOUR HEAD AS WE GET MORE COMMENTS FROM FED MEMBERS? >> WE'VE BEEN SITTING ON THE FENCE AT TWO, THREE, FOUR ABOUT TWO WEEKS NOW. SO THIS JUST TIPPED US OVER THE FENCE. I AGREE WITH STEVE THAT THE CPI NUMBERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE JOBS NUMBERS, BECAUSE CHAIR POWELL HIMSELF SAID HE WELCOMES STRONG EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. BUT EMBEDDED INTHOSE EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE A TICK UP IN HOURS WORKED, THAT'S GREAT, MORE EARNINGS. BUT THAT KEEPS THE UNDERLYING DEMAND VERY STRONG IN THE ECONOMY. AGAIN, THE NUMBERS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR ARE SO STRONG. 2/3 OF THE GAINS IN THOSE BIG THREE, LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY, HEALTH CARE, AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME. THE GOOD NEWS IS, IT'S NOT QUITE AS CONCENTRATED AS IT WAS IN 2023, WHICH MEANS SOME OF THE GAINS ARE SPREADING OUT A LITTLE MORE. WE SAW SOME STRONG GAINS IN CONSTRUCTION, AS WELL. AND RETAIL STILL HOLDING UP IN THERE. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE MORE DISPERSED GAINS, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AS SUSCEPTIBLE TO NEGATIVE SHOCKS. THAT GETS TO THE RISK STEVE LAID OUT EARLIER, THAT THERE COULD BE SOME UPSIDE RISK FOR INFLATION GOING FORWARD, GIVEN THE STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY. AND THE PERSISTENCE PARTICULARLY IN THE SERVICE SECTOR. >> STEVE, WE'VE BEEN TALKING THIS WEEK ABOUT THAT UPSIDE RISK, WHETHER YOU LOOK AT COMMODITY PRICES OR WAGE GROWTH, A LOT OF FOLKS ARE FOCUSING ON THAT AND THE JOBS REPORT. DOES THAT TELL US THAT THE FED HAS MORE ROOM, WHAT THE NEXT CATALYSTS ARE, ARE WE HEARING FROM MORE SPEAK SNERS >> THANKFULLY, I DON'T THINK SO. >> YOU'VE BEEN BUSY THIS WEEK. >> WE HAVE 15 SPEAKERS. >> WE COULD ALL USE A BREAK. >> I WAS ABOUT TO CRAWL UP IN THE FETAL POSITION IN THE LAST ONE. IT WAS 18 PAGES. BUT WE DO IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO. LISTEN, I THINK THAT THE WAGE NUMBERS ARE BETTER -- ARE OKAY, AS LONG AS -- HERE'S THE FORMULA -- THE WAGE GROWTH IS NOT GREATER THAN THE INFLATION NUMBER PLUS PRODUCTIVITY. THAT IS NOT INFLATIONARY WAGE GROWTH. I BELIEVE WE'RE THERE. I DO NOT BELIEVE, AND DIANA WILL ALWAYS CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, I DON'T BELIEVE FED OFFICIALS HAVE TALKED ABOUT WAGES PUSHING UP INFLATION. I BELIEVE THEY TALKED ABOUT THE THREAT OF WAGES PUSHING UP INFLATION. SO THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE PART OF THEIR CONSTRUCT OF THE DYNAMIC RIGHT NOW. >> OKAY. >> ONE MORE POINT. DIANE, REAL QUICK. ON THE CONSTRUCTION THING, I LOOKED THAT UP. VERY INTERESTING, NON-RESIDENTIAL SPECIALTY TRADE CONTRACTORS, WHO ARE THOSE? THE PEOPLE DOING THE GOVERNMENT PROJECTS. SO WE MIGHT BE SEEING SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL SHOWING UP IN THE JOBS REPORT. THAT'S MAYBE -- I'VE GOT TO LOOK BACK AND SEE, BUT THAT'S WHERE THOSE FOLKS ARE, 39,000. >> DIANE, GO AHEAD. >> YEP. AND THAT NUMBER WAS UP FROM 19,000 OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS. SO 39,000 IS A BIG NUMBER. IN A MONTH, WE EXPECT CONSTRUCTION TO PICK UP, BECAUSE IT'S MARCH. AND THAT'S WHEN SPRING USUALLY COMES MOST PLACES, ALTHOUGHIN CHICAGO, IT SEEMS TO BE LACKING. I THINK THAT NUMBER WAS IMPORTANT TOO. BUT MORE BROADLY, WE'RE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DRY TINDER IN THE HOUSING MARKET. IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE THE FED OFFICIALS TALK ABOUT THE PERSISTENCE OF INFLATION IN THE SHELTER SECTOR. THAT'S BEEN INTERESTING COMING OUT OF AUSTAN GOOLSBEE'S MOUTH THIS WEEK. WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH FROM FED OFFICIALS, BUT IT'S BEEN MOVING DOWN THEIR NUMBER OF RATE CUTS RATHER THAN MOVING UP. >> STEVE, BREAK DOWN THIS IDEA OF IMMIGRATION AND HOW THIS IS KEEPING THE JOB MARKET STRONG AND ALSO RELATING TO SOME OF THOSE HOUSING AND REMITTING PRICES. >> I'LL PREFACE THIS BY SAYING THE FED WANTS TO STAY AWAY FROM INFLATION LIKE IT'S -- OR IMMIGRATION LIKE THE PLAGUE. IT DOES NOT WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THE POLITICS OF IT. WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TAKING THE CARDS DEALT TO THEM, THE CARDS THAT HAVE BEEN DEALT TO THEM IS MUCH HIGHER IMMIGRATION. I BELIEVE THAT THE CBO JUST UPGRADED BY LIKE 4 MILLION THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY, DOCUMENTED I GUESS AND UNDOCUMENTED, AS WELL. THOSE FOLKS ARE SHOWING UP IN THE PAYROLL REPORT. THEY SEEM TO BE BODIES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PUT TO WORK. AND WHAT THE WAGES ARE AT THOSE LEVELS, I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ON THE BOOKS. I BELIEVE THEY SEEM TO BE MOSTLY ENDING UP IN SOME COUNTED WAY ON THE BOOKS, ON THE TAX ROLLS IN THAT RESPECT. SO THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF. BUT IMMIGRATION NUMBERS ARE FUELING JOB GROWTH. JOB GROWTH IS FUELING GROWTH. WE APPEAR TO HAVE A VERY LARGE DEMAND FOR LABOR IN THIS COUNTRY, AND GOING BACK TO THE SOURCE OF THIS WHOLE THING, I DON'T THINK -- I'M GETTING SOME HATE MAIL ON THIS -- BUT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THEIR HOMES THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY AND WALKING HERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE A PROSPECT OF GETTING A JOB. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE
