[Music] while much media attention this week focused on the solar eclipse a significant historic development occurred in the baltics for the first time since World War II Germany is stationing its troops outside the country German defense minister Boris Pistorius held German troops in Lithuania as an important step forward for his country and NATO is this a start of an escalating war in Ukraine well here with more is John Holzman he European policy expert and author of the book The Last best hope a history of American realism John thank you for being with us so in addition to the German troop uh development last month we heard French president macron talk about the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine so is NATO about to take more aggressive action in Ukraine's war against Russia no um this is dinner theater um I live in I live in Europe and they couldn't take action if they wanted to the problem is that for the last two Generations the European allies and let's call them out specifically the Germans the Spanish and the Italians primarily have spent almost nothing on defense they've been Lotus heaters taking a holiday from history uh cross subsidizing their safety net off America and now that the bill is being put forward and when they talk about these things they're simply not credible well last week in Brussels US Secretary of State blinkin insisted Ukraine will become a member of NATO Now isn't that one reason why Russia invaded Ukraine to begin with Putin wanted to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO your thoughts on Ukraine NATO membership is it accelerating maybe coming sooner rather than later it would be catastrophic but the good news is that you need unanimity to do this and while secretary blinkin indulges in magical realism a trump Administration wouldn't put this forward for a couple reasons one Ukraine doesn't qualify NATO membership is a very specific thing you need to be a purely Democratic state this is a country that suspended elections unlike the United States during our civil war suspended elections throughout the duration of their War uh has stopped other media from Outlets from having a a say in what goes on and have banned political parties that's not very Democratic and I run a large political risk room and let me say Ukraine is far from an ideal capitalistic State highly corrupt to the point that we've given them $1 110 billion dollar without auditing where that money goes and a good portion of it went in a black hole so secretary blinkin can say what whatever he wants but they're 32 NATO countries a good number of them don't want Ukraine in for all these reasons and neither with a republican Administration well then you have British foreign secretary David Cameron pressuring speaker Mike Johnson to push through additional us funding for Ukraine through the House of Representatives what do you expect will happen there in an election year when many members of Congress say the US Southern border is a greater priority for the country and as you mentioned there hasn't been an audit no this is the thing that what the Republicans in the house are saying is simply enough we can't do everything which should be apparent to everyone but evidently secretary blinkin what you need to do is make choices and we need to repair our border first and foremost every state must control its sovereignty first and foremost and so if there's a limited amount of things to do a third order priority like Ukraine shouldn't be what our congressmen and senators are worried about they should worry about making America sitting on a hill or dealing with things like China which is a peer superpower competitor and not a third order priority like Ukraine well why do you think no one's talking peace then right now and pushing negotiations to end this war that's a great question Gary and the problem is and I've studied Wars all my life and my firm does until both sides realize the futility of getting what they want through War they will continue to fight and both sides still think they can quote unquote win the war including president zalinsky of Ukraine was indulging in some magical thinking unlike his former uh chief of Defense General Zusi who says at the time look it's a stalemate and was pressuring zalinsky to come to the table we're sadly another bloodletting season away from getting down to the Brass tax but in the end they will come to the table because neither side will get what they want through War but we will have to have more deaths and more wasted time and lives along the way so this is a crisis the United States should steer well clear of well again Donald Trump says if he returns to the White House he could end it quickly so your thoughts on that John well I think so I mean the deal that you know that has been put in place is a deal realists like myself who are uh close to jeffersonians and jacksonians in the Republican Party would put forward you set up an Armistice line like occurred in Korea you give the ukrainians or the Europeans do an awful lot of money the Europeans are up for doing that a path to EU membership and a hedgehog strategy so Putin can't swallow them whole and you tell the Russians that if they play kniv sanctions over time will gradually be relieved but can be snapped back immediately that's the deal the problem is getting people to that deal and we're not there yet but I applaud president Trump for thinking ahead because we've got to start talking about ending this war which is doing nobody any good so how do we get them to the bargaining table they have to have more people lose they have to have more off offensives go wrong there has to be a stalemate for longer until both sides realize they can't get what they want from fighting as clwt said uh war is just politics by other means once they realize War won't get them what they want they'll go back to politics to negotiating okay John Holman foreign policy expert author of the book The Last best hope the history of American realism thank you for sharing your thoughts we appreciate it John my pleasure Garrett
