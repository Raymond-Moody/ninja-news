>> RIGHT. WELL, LET'S START WITH A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TORONTO, WHERE WE JUST SAW THE CANADIAN MARKET HIT ANOTHER INTRADAY ALL-TIME HIGH. THE NEW. RECORD AT 20 TO 3.80. AND OF COURSE, WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW THE STOCK MARKET RALLY NORTH AMERICA HAS BEEN BROADENING OUT THIS MORNING. WE'VE GOT MATERIALS AND FINANCIALS HELPING OUT THE YEAR TO DATE PERFORMANCE, THOUGH, ALSO TELLS US THE STORY OF OF OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN TORONTO, WHERE YOU'VE HAD ENERGY IS A GROUP OF MORE THAN 15% MATERIALS, DOUBLE DIGIT GAIN, INDUSTRIALS, A DOUBLE DIGIT GAME. LET'S GET SOME MORE PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE MARKETS. JOINING US MY CORE CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST WITH JONES TRADING MIKE, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT WHAT STARTED AS A BIG RALLY IN TECH HAS INCREASINGLY BEEN EXTENDING TO OTHER SECTORS OF THE STOCK MARKET. >> YEAH, I ACTUALLY THINK THE TECH PORTION AROUND IS GETTING A LITTLE TIRED HERE. AS YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE GOING ELSEWHERE. I THINK THE INFLATION REEMERGING OR AT LEAST FROM AN YOU KNOW, STANDPOINT. SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING GOAL THAT. WELL, YOU SEE OIL AT BETTER. AND I THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FEAR THAT THINGS THAT WHAT YOU KNOW, THE MAJOR S&P RALLY WAS, YOU KNOW, THE TAX RALLIES PREDICATED ON ARE STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT. >> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT GOLD, IF WE CAN RIGHT NOW, WHICH CONTINUES TO HIT THESE RECORD HIGHS. WALK US THROUGH YOUR THESIS, YOU, YOU GIVE US SOME OF IT ON ON WHAT YOU THINK IT'S BEEN DRIVING THAT INTEREST IN BULLION, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY HAS HAS DRIVEN A LOT OF INTEREST IN STOCKS TIED TO THAT TRADE. A MATERIAL SECTOR STOCKS, ETC. >> SO I THINK GOLD RALLY ACTUALLY STARTED BITCOIN TO POINT WHEN INCREDIBLE TEAR IN GOLD. BUT WITH YOU KNOW, COMPETITIVE ASSET, BUT I THINK YOU'RE SEEING A TRANSFORMATION IN THE MARKET MIGHT SAID, YOU KNOW, WITH THE INFLATION DATA, WE'VE HAD US THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS OF THE YEAR, OBVIOUSLY, OF THIS BIG CPI REPORT TOMORROW MORNING. AND THEN YOU HAVE COMMENTS LIKE THAT COMES FROM JAMIE FROM JP MORGAN STAY. JUST WORRY ABOUT INFLATION BEING A LITTLE MORE PERSISTENT OUT THERE. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION TO THAT, YOU HAVE YOUR THE CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST PUSH OIL PRICES UP. SO YOU KNOW, THIS MORNING WE HAD THE NFI, THE WHERE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, THE UNITED STATES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT INFLATION. SO YOU'VE SEEN THAT GROWING AGAIN. I THINK GOLD IS HITTING ALL-TIME HIGHS, IT HAS LEGS, THINGS LIKE BITCOIN WORKING WORKING. PETE. OF COURSE, IT'S IT'S ON LOVE RELATIVE TO US TECHNOLOGY. SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING ELSEWHERE. WE ARE GOING TO GET SOME MORE INFLATION NUMBERS IN THE U.S. TOMORROW. WE'VE ALSO GOT A BANK OF CANADA INTEREST RATE DECISION EVERY DAY THE MARKET IS TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE FED ON INTEREST RATES GOING FORWARD BASED ON THE INFLATION TRENDS RIGHT NOW. WHAT'S YOUR CURRENT VIEW ON ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE U.S. THIS YEAR? >> SO IT'S INTERESTING WHEN CHAIRMAN POWELL SPOKE ONLY GOOD FRIDAY AT THE SAN FRANCISCO FED. HE SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT CONFIDENCE, HE WANTS TO BE A, YOU KNOW, A SERIES OF READING SIMILAR TO WE HAD THE SECOND YEAR OF LAST YEAR IN 2023. WOULD YOU BE CORE PC? YOU KNOW, 3, 6, MONTH. OWE YOU ANNUALIZE REACH RUNNING AT 2%. WE'RE RUNNING PROBABLY CLOSE TO 4% RIGHT NOW. SO EVEN IF WE HAVE A GOOD NUMBER TOMORROW, I THINK IT'S HARD FOR THAT TO GET DOWN TO 2% LEVEL BY THE JUNE MEETING, WHICH IS WHERE EXPECTATIONS OF SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO BACK OFF EXPECTATION OF 3 RE CAUSE THIS YEAR. AND YOU KNOW, I WOULD SAY WE'RE PROBABLY MORE IN THE CAMP OF ONE, NOTICE THAT WOULD LIKE THE EAST. SO PUT IT TO BECAUSE THAT'S ADVICE IS. BUT RIGHT NOW THE DATA IS ESPECIALLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE STRONG JOBS REPORT. WE JUST RECEIVED A FRIDAY. THE DATA IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE FED CUTTING RATES IN IMMEDIATE FUTURE. RIGHT? AND WE HAD A WEAKER THAN EXPECTED JOBS REPORT IN CANADA AND THE BANK OF CANADA. ALL THE U.S. IS GOING TO BE WATCHING WHAT THE FED DOES AS WELL. SO. >> HIGHLIGHTING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 2 ECONOMIES RIGHT NOW. HOWEVER, HOW MUCH OF A POSSIBLE SHIFT IN EXPECTATIONS DO YOU THINK IS PRICED INTO THE MARKET? LIKE IF WE WERE TO HAVE A SCENARIO, WHICH IS USED AS AN EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY THERE'S ONE RATE CUT BY THE FED THIS YEAR. >> JUST PUT THAT OUT, THERE IS THE STOCK DOES, IT WOULD NEED TO ADJUST, YOU THINK TO THAT. >> I THINK IT WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE THE 10 YEAR TREASURY YIELD IS HIGHER THAN S&P 500 EARNINGS YIELD, FIRST TIME IN A COUPLE OF DECADES. I MEAN, THAT WAS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS PERSIST. 90'S, AS YOU KNOW, INFLATION IS CONTINUALLY COMING DOWN TREASURES WERE JUST SLOW TO RALLY BEHIND SO I I THINK THIS MARKET AS PRETTY HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF AND THAT IS GOING BREAKING RIGHT DIRECTION. A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE FED STOPPED RAISING RATES LAST SUMMER AND BY THE FALL, THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING RATES AGAIN, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT OPTIMISM THAT BUILT INTO THE SEA AND AND WE SLAYING, IT'S CLEAR THE FENCE BIASES, THEY WANT TO CUT RATES, THEY JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE DATA THAT ALLOWS HIM TO DO IT SO I THINK WHEN THE EXPECTATION SHIFT EMERGES, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE SOME TYPE OF RE-RATING IN MARKET. >> AND WE'RE ALMOST AT A TIME LIKE, BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 10 YEAR TREASURY EXCEEDING THE S&P 500 EARNINGS YIELD. JUST WALK US THROUGH WHY THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO YOU. >> WELL, IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, 10 YEAR TREASURIES OF RISK-FREE INVESTMENT. AND IF YOU INVEST IN THE EQUITY MARKET IS A LOT MORE VOLATILITY TIED TO SO WITH S&P 500 EARNINGS YIELD ABOUT 4.3% AND THAT'S ABOUT 23 AND A HALF TIMES EARNINGS. THAT'S, Y KNOW, IT'S AN EXPENSIVE HISTORICAL EQUITY TATE AND THAT'S A RELATIVELY TREASURY YIELD. AND AS THEY COMPETE FOR US IS THAT IF THE 10 YEAR YIELD CONTINUES TO RISE PEOPLE SHOULD VYING FOR THE SEAT FOR, YO KNOW, THE OUR POLITICAL RISK. PLUS ASSET AS OPPOSED TO RISKY OR THE RISKY. AND THERE IS, YES, IT SHOULD HAVE TO REPRICE TO BECOME
