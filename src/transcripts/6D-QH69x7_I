THE STATE OF EVS:
Tesla is getting annihilated. In fact, since their peak back in 2021, Tesla
stock is down 57% which correlates to a market cap loss of $735 billion. And this is during a time when tech stocks
are doing better than ever. Meta all-time high. Google all-time high. Amazon all-time high. Microsoft all-time high. And Nvidia? Well, you already know. It’s not just Tesla’s stock price that’s
getting crushed either. Tesla’s fundamentals aren’t looking great
either. Tesla’s quarterly revenue has stagnated
since the end of 2022, their gross profit has declined by 23%, and their operating income
is down 50%. Technically, their net income is actually
up big, but that’s not because the business is doing well but because Tesla received a
whopping $5.9 billion one-time tax credit. Now, all of this might not seem that bad. At the end of the day, their still the largest
automotive company, they still lead the EV industry by far, and, they’re the only ones
who have been able to build a profitable business around EVs. But, here’s the thing, the only reason that
narrative worked was because Tesla was expected to put in massive growth numbers year after
year. In fact, since 2020, Elon Musk has been promising
a long-term annual growth rate of 50%, presumably until Tesla reaches 10 million vehicles per
year. But, in 2023, Tesla only delivered 1.8 million
vehicles which correlates to a growth rate of 38%. More concerningly, Tesla themselves have admitted
that delivery growth in 2024 will be notably lower than in 2023. Some analysts even expect Tesla’s deliveries
to fall next year. And all of that is despite constant price
cuts and tax credits which have made the Model 3 as cheap as $23,000 in California. The more time that goes on, the more it seems
that Tesla is much more of an automotive company as opposed to a tech company. And if that truly is the case, well, Tesla
stock has a lot more downside left as the company is still worth $200 billion more than
Toyota despite only delivering a fifth of the vehicles. Also, Tesla is only the tip of the iceberg. Zooming out, the rest of the EV industry is
doing way worse. Stocks like Rivian, Lucid, and Nio are down
well over 90%. And most of these EV startups are just trying
to avoid bankruptcy at this point. In fact, many of their investors are just
hoping that the bigger investors will bail these companies out. Amazon in the case of Rivian, the Saudis in
the case of Lucid, and the CCP in the case of Nio. And it’s not just the newer EV players either. Legacy automakers are having an equally difficult
time. Ford, for example, has completely stopped
shipping the F150 Lightning because demand is simply so low. Also, Ford has been losing $36,000 on every
EV they’ve sold which is even worse than Rivian’s $33,000 loss per vehicle. Nothing is as bad as Lucid’s $227,000 loss
per car though. Clearly, the EV bubble has popped and we have
yet to find a bottom. But what happened? Weren’t EVs supposed to be the next big
thing? Well, let’s find out. INTEREST RATES:
If you're interested in having companies pay you, check out our bond investing app Silo
in the description below, but anyway, to understand what happened to the EV industry, we have
to go back to the peak of the hype which was back in late 2021. At the time, we actually made a video called
Rivian - The Epitome Of The EV Bubble. To be honest, this wasn’t that hard to spot
because Rivian boasted a valuation of $150 billion which not only made them the largest
US company with no revenue but also made them larger than Volkswagen. It wasn’t just investors who were hyped
either. Consumers were even more hyped. People were waiting 3 to 6 months to take
delivery of their Teslas and they were paying record high prices. The Model 3 started at $47,000, the Model
Y started at $63,000, the Model S started at $100,000, and the Model X started at $115,000. Rivian would also hike prices by 20% just
as they started delivering their first vehicles. And then everything changed in March of 2022
when the Fed started hiking rates from 0%. Up until this point, Tesla was regularly offering
0% interest rate programs which made their cars far more affordable. Rate hikes didn’t affect the EV industry
all that much over the first 3 to 6 months, but it would catch up quick. Tesla currently charges 6.5% interest and
that’s for people with excellent credit. For people with fair credit, that number goes
up to over 11%. In other words, the same cars suddenly cost
20 to 30% more because more of your car payment was going to interest. And this was especially relevant for higher-end
vehicles like the Model S and X as well as Rivians and Lucids. Now, for the record, buying a luxury vehicle
using a car loan is usually a terrible idea, but that’s what a lot of people do. The only way that EV makers could fight this
new reality was by slashing prices like there’s no tomorrow, and that’s exactly what happened. The Model 3 dropped from $47,000 to $39,000,
the Model Y dropped from $63,000 to $44,000, the Model S dropped from $100,000 to $75,000,
and the Model X dropped from $115,000 all the way down to $80,000. These price drops naturally crushed Tesla’s
gross margins from 27% down to 18%, but given Tesla’s maturity, they were able to survive
these price cuts which are still ongoing. It was a completely different story with the
rest of the industry though. Take Lucid for example. When the Lucid Air launched in 2022, the price
was $140,000 and Lucid actually increased prices to $155,000. Now, Lucid has launched more affordable variants
since then, but do you wanna guess what the Lucid Air starts at today? $69,900. Yeah, that’s why Lucid is losing over $200,000
on every single car they sell. This is pretty rough as an EV maker, but from
the consumer’s perspective, this is great right, especially if you’re a smart buyer
who’s paying cash. All of those massive price cuts will go straight
to your pocket. You can buy a Model 3 for as little as $23,000. That should skyrocket demand, right? Well, that’s what you would think but that’s
not what’s happening. Despite record low prices, EV sales are stagnating
and even declining and that brings us to the next fatal blow for the EV industry: consumer
interest. WANING INTEREST:
EVs have long been described as the inevitable future of the automotive industry and if your
timeframe is long enough, that’s still true. But, maybe that future isn’t as close as
we originally envisioned. For example, New York wants all sales and
leases of new light-duty passenger vehicles to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035, and
they want heavy-duty vehicles to follow the same trend by 2045, but is this actually realistic? At this point, 2035 is only 11 years away
and despite all the EV hype, EVs only account for 1% of registered vehicles on the road
in the US. EVs are fairing a lot better when it comes
to sales, but even there, we’re only talking 6.5% market share. So, what gives? Well, historically, EV enthusiasts would argue
that the main bottleneck was price. If EVs were just cheap enough, everyone would
switch over, but EVs are cheap enough today. EVs aren’t quite comparable with used cars
yet, but if you’re buying a new car today, EVs have extremely competitive price tags,
not to mention, the money you would save in terms of gas, maintenance, and tax credits. At the very least, EVs are cheap enough to
control 25 or 30% of the market, yet they only control 6.5% and sales are slowing which
makes it abundantly clear that the average American isn’t nearly as interested in EVs
as you might think and cost isn’t the only factor. The leading concerns all seem to be regarding
range and charging. Nowadays, we see a bunch of EVs claiming to
have ranges of 300 to 400 miles, but it’s not the same as a gas vehicle with 300 to
400 miles of range. If you turn up the heater and it’s cold
outside, your range is gonna get crushed with an EV. Not to mention, it’s not only harder to
find a charging station but it’ll take way longer to charge than to just fill up gas. If you have a short commute and can charge
at home every day, this isn’t a big deal, but for more versatile use cases like road
trips, living in an apartment, or even just forgetting to charge, owning an EV is often
a headache. That’s why most people who do own an EV
still keep around a gas car as well. What it seems like is that all the people
who were pro-EV and were willing to deal with these shortfalls simply already got an EV. And, now it’s far far harder to convince
the actual general public. This trend is perfectly depicted by Tesla’s
crashing Full Self Driving take rates. Back in 2019, the take rate for the Model
3 was nearly 50%. This was because everyone who was buying the
Model 3 were innovators. They not only wanted an EV but the latest
tech possible which included self-driving technology. But, as we moved into the 2020s, the FSD take
rate plummeted all the way to 7% as early adopters entered the market and weren’t
as willing to put up the hefty price for beta software. And now, we’re moving from the early adopter
phase to the early majority phase, and these people want a fully polished product including
fast charge times, reliable range, great charging infrastructure, strong performance under all
weather conditions, and so on. And until EV makers are not just able to deliver
a low price but also a refined experience, it’s gonna be an uphill battle. THE RACE HEATS UP:
And that brings us to the last major obstacle that EV makers are facing which is that the
competition is heating up. For starters, Rivian just announced their
more affordable R2 and R3 lines which have seen an extremely positive response. Lucid is also expected to introduce a new
EV SUV in the near future. These sorts of announcements are not only
cannibalizing their own vehicles but also vastly increasing the competition. For example, a lot of people who were thinking
about buying the Rivian R1S or the Tesla Model Y are now just looking to buy the R2. But, that’s not even the competition that
I’m talking about. The competition I’m actually referring to
is legacy automakers. Now, the EV community has had a blast clowning
on the legacy auto industry for years, saying things like they’ll never catch up, or they’re
done for. And for the most part, that was completely
true. Legacy leaders like Toyota, Honda, and Nissan
have completely dropped the ball when it comes to EVs. GM, Ford, and Volkswagen have done a much
better job, but it’s still nothing to brag about, but what about the legacy underdogs,
more specifically, Kia and Hyundai? Now, if you’re like me, you're probably
too big of an EV enthusiast to even consider EVs from these companies, but that’s not
true about the average person. For the average person who’s just looking
for a practical, affordable EV from a brand they recognize and trust with service centers
everywhere, Kia and Hyundai are awesome options. In fact, while the rest of the EV industry
is flatlining or declining, Hyundai enjoyed a 40% increase in Ioniq sales and Kia enjoyed
a 65% increase in EV6 and EV9 sales. This isn’t to say that Kia and Hyundai are
gonna overtake Tesla or something, but it’s likely that the early majority is looking
for something a lot different than what innovators and early adopters were looking for. And legacy makers may do better than expected
with this market segment even if they are late and don’t produce the fastest cars
or the coolest cars because at the end of the day, while they may not be at the bleeding
edge of EV technology, they know what consumers want more than anybody else. Also, as a side note, I would argue the same
thing with self-driving technology as well. Tesla autopilot has long been described as
being too far ahead to catch up, and maybe that’s true for Google, Rivian, GM, and
Ford, but what about Nvidia? Nvidia has been involved in the autopilot
space for as long as Tesla. And given that the entire tech world relies
on Nvidia’s AI infrastructure, it’s very possible that Nvidia can not only catch up
to Tesla but overtake Tesla. None of this is to say that Tesla is done
for. After this soft spot in demand passes and
EV hype picks up again, it’s likely that Tesla will be able to start scaling quickly
once again, and they will likely remain a leader in autonomy. Also, hopefully, Rivian and Lucid are able
to pull through because they make great cars and competition is always good. But, with Apple not even wanting to enter
the market despite spending 10 years and $10 billion on their own car, it’s clear that
that journey is gonna be way longer and harder than what EV investors were hoping for. If you're interested in deeper dives, interviews
