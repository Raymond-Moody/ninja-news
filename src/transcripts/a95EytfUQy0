The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its jobs report for the past month. And analysts believe that our country's unemployment rate could return to what we haven't seen since before the pandemic. Annie joins us now with what we can expect. Hey, good morning, Alison. Good morning, everybody. For the past 50 years, the US unemployment rate has mostly been far above 4% even rocketing to almost 15% during the pandemic. Yet in the period that followed, it has stayed below 4% for more than two years. But that could change today when the March jobs report comes out ahead of today's announcement, the Minneapolis Federal Reserve President is warning that a positive jobs report could mean bad news for interest rates. If we continue to see strong job growth. If we continue to see strong consumer spending and strong GDP growth, then that raises a question in my mind. Well, why would we cut rates? Maybe the dynamics that we have right now are actually sustainable. Many would disagree with that. Thanks to, of course, spending more on groceries and gas. Despite this concern though Fed Chair Jerome Powell says most of its members are more optimistic. Let's focus now on our local unemployment rates. Take a look. A new report released just this week shows unemployment was up in the DC metro area in February, up to 3% from 2.8% in January. And last February among all metro areas with a population of 1 million or more. Nashville had the lowest jobless rate at 2.2%. San Bernardino, California had the highest at 5.5%. So it's really eye opening when you see these jobs reports. Sort of, it gives you a sense of where we are. Uh, not only locally but as a country we're looking forward to it. Uh, the jobs report coming out in about two hours. Annie, thanks.
