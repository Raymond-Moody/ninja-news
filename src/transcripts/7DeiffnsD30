meet hmon Beck he's just won a prestigious award for his invention it's called SATs and that stands for skin cancer treating so its main purpose is to treat minor forms of skin cancer but perhaps most impressive his age hymon is just 14 as part of 3m's young scientist challenge he came up with a lowcost soap that delivers cancer fighting drugs via nanop particles which work to activate the body's immune cells to fend off cancer the High School freshman from Virginia was four years old when he immigrated from Ethiopia he says it was those years in his native land that inspired his creation I actually saw a lot of people who were working long hours under the hot sun people work really long hours in the Sun and there is no a awareness or any sort of information being shared around about how dangerous sun exposure really is so then when they do end up developing issues like skin cancers uh it's really just incred inedibly difficult for them to be able to afford the affordable cures and the best part of hman soap is just how affordable it is it only cost as low as $8.50 in comparison to modern day Skin Cancer Treatments which the average price of skin cancer treatment is almost $40,000 his soap won him that 3M Challenge and he's been awarded $25,000 which he plans to use on helping secure a patent for the soap and to help pay for college he's got big plans for the future so by 2028 I actually hope to turn this bar of soap into a nonprofit organization where I can provide Equitable and accessible skin cancer treatment to as many people as possible this could change a lot of lives Heyman is looking to conduct human testing on the soap and then eventually get FDA certification hi everyone George Stephanopoulos here thanks for checking out the ABC News YouTube channel if you'd like to get more videos show highlights and watch live event coverage click on the right over here to subscribe to our Channel and don't forget to download the ABC News app for breaking news alert thanks for watching
